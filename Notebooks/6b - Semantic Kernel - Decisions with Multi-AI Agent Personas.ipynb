    "The previous example was quite simplistic as it basically put several agents together with a moderator and it completed once the words \"Final Decision\" were emitted. Advanced multi-agent orchestrations can provide much more powerful control around how agents work together. Semantic Kernel supports several orchestration patterns, each designed for different collaboration scenarios. These patterns are available as part of the framework and can be easily extended or customized. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of these patterns is the Magnetic orchestration, which is a powerful multi-agent pattern designed for managing complex, open-ended tasks. The Magentic orchestration in Semantic Kernel is inspired by the \"Magentic-One\" system. It involves a dedicated Magentic manager that coordinates a team of specialized agents to solve intricate problems. This manager is powered by an AI model to perform the coordination. It selects the next agent based on different factors in the process like: task progress, agent capabilities, evolving context etc. "
