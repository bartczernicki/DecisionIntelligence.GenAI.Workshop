Advanced multi-agent orchestrations can provide much more powerful control around how agents work together. Semantic Kernel supports several orchestration patterns, each designed for different collaboration scenarios. These patterns are available as part of the framework and can be easily extended or customized. \n",

    "One of these patterns is the Magnetic orchestration, which is a powerful multi-agent pattern designed for managing complex, open-ended tasks. The Magentic orchestration in Semantic Kernel is inspired by the \"Magentic-One\" system. It involves a dedicated Magentic manager that coordinates a team of specialized agents to solve intricate problems. This manager is powered by an AI model to perform the coordination. It selects the next agent based on different factors in the process like: task progress, agent capabilities, evolving context etc. "

       "| **Hidden Assumption: Both assets will grow equally over the long term** | It isn’t safe to assume either real estate or Bitcoin will offer steady, comparable appreciation. Real estate returns are heavily location- and timing-dependent; Bitcoin’s price is volatile and vulnerable to regulatory shocks. Growth prospects for both could diverge dramatically.                                                                                                                     | Analyze historical returns and volatility for both asset classes over various timeframes. Model upside and downside.   |\n",
       "| **Blind Spot: Liquidity Needs, Especially With College Approaching**   | Rental property is illiquid; selling may take months or more, especially during downturns. Bitcoin can be sold quickly, but price may be volatile at needed moments. Your future college expenses are a time-certain liquidity need in 5 years.                                                                                                                     | Map out likely cash flow needs. Determine if/when the investment needs to be partially liquidated for tuition, etc.   |\n",
       "| **Potential Risk: Concentration vs. Diversification**                  | With $500k in one property or Bitcoin, you’re highly concentrated. Real estate means one asset, one location; Bitcoin could be a single highly volatile asset. Either approach carries significant single-asset risk, conflicting with risk mitigation goals.                                                                                                       | Consider if partial allocation (some in cash, stocks, bonds, REITs, etc.) would improve risk-adjusted returns.        |\n",
       "| **Feasibility: Time, Effort, and Expertise**                           | Rental property ownership often entails dealing with tenants, repairs, local laws, and property managers—possibly overwhelming for a real estate novice. Bitcoin security (private keys, exchanges), taxation, and staying updated on crypto risks require technical savvy. Both may demand more expertise and time than expected.                      | Research required skill sets and time commitments; consider “hands-off” alternatives like REITs or crypto ETFs.       |\n",
       "| **Unintended Consequence: Regulatory and Tax Risks**                   | Rental property is subject to changing property taxes, rent control, and zoning laws. Bitcoin faces shifting regulations, tax reporting rules, or even outright bans in some countries. Either investment could face rising compliance costs or legal uncertainty impacting value.                                                                              | Consult with financial and tax advisors. Stay informed on local real estate and crypto regulatory outlook.             |\n",
       "| **Risks: Ongoing Costs Overlooked**                                    | Rental ownership includes insurance, taxes, vacancies, management, repairs, and possible special assessments. Bitcoin’s “storage” and custodial security costs are lower but risks of hacking or platform failure are not negligible. These costs can erode returns.                                                   | Draft comprehensive pro-forma cash flow projections for property. Research crypto custody and security solutions.      |\n",
       "| **Stakeholder Buy-in: Family Preferences & Risk Appetite**             | The psychological impact of large losses (if property crashes or Bitcoin plummets) may strain family stability, especially when college and future security are at stake. Your risk perception may not match your partner’s or children’s needs.                                                                       | Have open family discussions about acceptable risk, financial tradeoffs, and contingency planning.                    |\n",
       "| **Counter-Argument: Hybrid Approach Overlooked**                       | Focusing on “either/or” between real estate and Bitcoin could be unnecessarily limiting. Diversifying between them, or including bonds, stocks, or cash, might deliver better risk/return alignment with your constraints and responsibilities.                                                                      | Model different portfolio mixes and stress test them against various negative market scenarios.                        |\n",
       "| **Further Data/Evidence Gaps**                                         | Without detailed knowledge of your chosen property’s location or your familiarity with secure crypto management, it’s hard to estimate projected returns or risk exposure. Both asset classes require “due diligence” above and beyond a basic understanding for a $500k decision.                       | Seek advice from local real estate pros and an experienced crypto fiduciary. Consider simulated investing first.       |"
