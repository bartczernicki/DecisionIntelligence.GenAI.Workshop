    "Decision communication is at the core of how decisions actually turn into results. Making a choice in your head is only the first half of the work. What truly shapes outcomes is how clearly that choice is shared with the people who need to understand it, act on it, or support it. This happens constantly in everyday life, whether we notice it or not: a quick “I’ll grab the kids at 5” prevents confusion, a manager’s “We’re delaying the launch by two weeks” resets priorities, and a doctor’s “Here’s why we’re changing your medication” builds trust and follow-through. Therefore, **decision communication is the practice of articulating the decision reasoning and the expected outcome**. Without that shared understanding, even excellent decisions can stall, fragment, or quietly fail."

    "The Rasiah framework is a simple way to make sure a decision is communicated clearly and doesn’t get misunderstood. The primary goal is to avoid being evasive when using this framework. This means you don’t talk around the decision, use vague words, or leave people guessing. When people are evasive, they often skip the “why,” hide the trade-offs, or avoid saying who is responsible, which creates confusion and mistrust. This framework helps you explain not only what was decided, but also the key details people need to act with confidence. In Rasiah, you share the Reason for the decision, the alternatives you considered, the scope of what’s included (and what’s not), the impact on people or plans, the action steps and who owns them, how you’ll track progress and when you’ll review the decision. Using Rasiah keeps messages short, complete, and easy to follow, so teams stay aligned and move faster. "

    "Imagine a scenario where during a company town hall an executive is communicating a company-wide decision around layoffs. For anyone with a long career has probably experienced this several times. Depending on how effective and direct that decision is being communicated by the executive, this can look quite differently. For example, the question could sound something like this:\n",

In our org, 12 roles are being cut, mostly in Operations and Program Management. Engineering on Project Atlas is not in scope. People affected will be notified this Friday by 2pm, and their access will change the same day for security reasons. \n",
    "* **Intermediate Response:** We’re making changes because the business climate is tough and we need to be more efficient. Some teams will be affected, including parts of our org. Leaders and HR are working through details. We’ll share more when we can. \n",
    "* **Evasion:** We’re always reviewing priorities to stay competitive. I can’t comment on specific teams or numbers. Let’s stay focused on delivering results this quarter. \n",

   "source": [
    "The Minto Pyramid is a simple way to organize your message from the top down so people get the point fast. Instead of building up to your conclusion, you start with it right away (your main takeaway or recommendation), then you share a few key points that explain why, and only after that do you add the supporting details like facts, numbers, or evidence. This works well because most people are busy and don’t want to dig through a long message just to find the main idea. It also lets readers stop after the key points if that’s enough, and only go deeper if they need the proof. "

    "The Minto Pyramid can be used to communicate decisions. To communicate a decision using the Minto Pyramid, start by stating the decision up front in one clear sentence (the “conclusion”), so nobody has to read to the end to find out what was decided. Then add a short set of key points that explain why you chose it—your main reasons, trade-offs, or what you’re optimizing for—kept as brief summaries. Finally, include the supporting details (facts, data, evidence, or background) for anyone who needs to validate the reasoning or implement the change. This top-down structure makes the message faster to understand, easier to agree on, and practical for busy readers who may only skim the top section."
