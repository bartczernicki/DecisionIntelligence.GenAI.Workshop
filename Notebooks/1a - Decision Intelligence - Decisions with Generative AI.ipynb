    "Decision-making is at the core of everything we do in life. It's an activity that happens all the time, whether we realize it or not. This process is deeply embedded in our human biology, guiding us through both conscious choices, like what car to purchase, and unconscious ones, like reflexively pulling our hand away from a hot surface. Every decision we make, big or small, plays a role in helping us navigate the world and stay safe. Without this constant decision-making, our ability to survive and thrive would be greatly diminished.  \n",

    "| :--------------------- | :------------- |\n",
    "| Deciding from Available Choices | This is what comes to mind when people think of decision-making; there are several choices presented and one makes a selection. Examples can include: selecting an optimal route to work, picking a new car or choosing which job offer to accept, making an offer to a candidate from a pool of applications etc. |\n",
    "| Quitting or Postponing | Stopping or planning when to quit an action is a form of a decision. For example, stopping your exercise routine at exhaustion or partially eating a meal for your diet are essentially stopping decisions. |\n",
    "| Making a Recommendation | Prescribing solutions, suggestions, choices etc. that address a problem or achieve a goal. Recommendations are form of a multiple potential decisions. | \n",
    "| Priorotizing or Escalating | Choosing which decisions to focus on based on their importance or urgency. Referring the decision to a higher authority or level for resolution.  | \n",
    "| Working with Groups | When working in a group setting like negotiating, collaborating or voting are some specific examples of decision forms when people come together as a group. | \n",
    "| Doing Nothing or Mainting the Status Quo | Maintaining the current state is a valid decision that sometimes isn't provided as a choice, but is almost always available as an option or strategy. |\n",

    "Decision Intelligence transformation may sound potentially interesting, but what does this have todo with Generative AI? Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities possess potential for enhancing decision-making processes through advanced reasoning abilities. These GenAI LLMs have been trained on complex data sets with logic, patterns, writing source (programming) code and problem solving in mind. This allows LLMs to simulate human-like reasoning, offering insights and recommendations based on comprehensive data analysis. So how does decision-making and Generative AI come together? **This means that the proven historical use of decision-making, problem-solving, mental models, decision huersistics can be appllied to LLMs with GenAI and help humans make decisions!**  \n",

For example, in the recent past the preferred way to communicate news stories or research was with the radio, tevelevision or newspapers. These past ways of communication have been digitally transformed with the internet and cell phones. Many examples like this exist.

    "| 1. Decision Framing | The manner a decision is approached has enormous importance on the quality of the decision. Poor decision framing has a snowball effect on subsquent decision-making tiers. It doesn't help that humans are poor at framing decisions. It is hard for humans to try different perspectives without personal cognitive biases getting in the way. While not perfect, Generative AI models can be instructed to approach various decisions from different perspectives, greatly adjusting bias. With Generative AI framing decisions, many perspectives can be simulated for both individual and group decisions. |  \n",
    "| 2. Gathering Intelligence | Generative AI can enhance the process of providing the proper contextual information using a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Semantic Search techniques. Traditional search systems (Google, Bing) have been based on keyword search algorithms. However, semantic techniques can understand the \"meaning\" of the context and pair it with data in a knowledge graph.  These new semantic search techniques have shown large improvements in accuracy and can provide more relevant data to a decision system. |\n",
    "| 3. Decision Execution | Generative AI models provide many enhancements in the decision execution step. Gen AI models can perform calculations, execute software code, apply decision frameworks, make recommendations etc. Simply, components of the Generative AI can act as your \"pair decision-maker\". This is further extended with the advent of agents, where multiple AI decision-makers can collaborate to execute decision task(s).  | \n",
    "| 4. Decision Communication | If you have use a Generative AI chatbot (ChatGPT), you have seen how Generative AI systems can effectively communicate decisions to the user; by writing text, paragraphs and even writing comprehensive reports. This can include describing the decision, explaining the reasoning process and applying specific communication techniques. This is truly revolutionary over past AI & Machine Learning techniques, where models generally returned only a single probability percentage or confidence score. In the past, it was up to the data scientist to translate complexity to additional communication. | \n",
    "| 5. Decision Monitoring | Generative AI innovations include ways where decisions can be evaluated, contrasted and compared. Furthremore, paired with business data, GenAI systems can continuously monitor the performance of existing decisions. |"
