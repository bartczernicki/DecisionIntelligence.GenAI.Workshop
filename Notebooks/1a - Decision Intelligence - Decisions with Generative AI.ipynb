    "Decision-making is at the core of everything we do in life. It's an activity that happens all the time, whether we realize it or not. This process is deeply embedded in our human biology, guiding us through both conscious choices, like what car to purchase, and unconscious ones, like reflexively pulling our hand away from a hot surface. Every decision we make, big or small, plays a role in helping us navigate the world and stay safe. Without this constant decision-making, our ability to survive and thrive would be greatly diminished.  \n",

    "We make decisions anytime we are presented with a how, why or when. Therefore, decisions can have various forms that aren't clearly apparent. Examples of decision forms are illustrated in the table below:  \n",
    "| Decision Form              | Description |\n",
    "| :--------------------- | :------------- |\n",
    "| Deciding from available Choices | This is what comes to mind when people think of decision-making; there are several choices presented and one makes a selection. Examples can include: selecting an optimal route to work, picking a new car or choosing which job offer to accept, making an offer to a candidate from a pool of applications etc. |\n",
    "| Quitting or Postponing | Stopping or planning when to quit an action is a form of a decision. For example, stopping your exercise routine at exhaustion or partially eating a meal for your diet are essentially stopping decisions. |\n",
    "| Making a Recommendation | Prescribing solutions, suggestions, choices etc. that address a problem or achieve a goal. Recommendations are form of a multiple potential decisions. | \n",
    "| Priorotizing or Escalating | Choosing which decisions to focus on based on their importance or urgency. Referring the decision to a higher authority or level for resolution.  | \n",
    "| Working with Groups | When working in a group setting like negotiating, collaborating or voting are some specific examples of decision forms in the group process. | \n",
    "| Doing Nothing or Mainting the Status Quo | Maintaining the current state is a valid decision that sometimes isn't provided as a choice, but is almost always available as an option or strategy. |\n",
    "| Deciding how you make decisions | Probably the most important set decisions you will ever make is how you approach, make, communicate and monitor sufficiently important decisions! |\n",

However, when the problem is sufficiently important or the chance of making a mistake is high; it is valuable to apply advanced decision-making principles to solve those problems.  \n",

    "Most individuals are not aware of decision-making techniques. Furthermore, to most, consistently making quality decisions can be a daunting task. There is good news though! It has been shown that in the same way with the training of top-tier athletes, decision-makers can employ techniques, plans, simple math and instruments to improve with practice.

    "Decision Intelligence sounds interesting, but what does this have todo with Generative AI? Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities possess potential for enhancing decision-making processes through advanced reasoning abilities. These GenAI LLMs have been trained on complex data sets with logic, patterns, writing source (programming) code and problem solving in mind. This allows LLMs to simulate human-like reasoning, offering insights and recommendations based on comprehensive data analysis. So how does decision-making and Generative AI come together? **This means that all of the historical use of decision-making, problem-solving, mental models, decision huersistics can be appllied to LLMs with GenAI and help humans make decisions!**  \n",

For example, in the recent past the preferred way to communicate news stories or research was with the radio, tevelevision or newspapers. This way of communication has been digitally transformed with the internet and cell phones. Many examples like this exist. With the recent Generative AI innovations, it is an ideal time for digital transformation of Decision Intelligence!\n",

The aim of this content is to present Decision Intelligence as an easy way to get comfortable with the techniques and then offer resources to go much deeper.  "
