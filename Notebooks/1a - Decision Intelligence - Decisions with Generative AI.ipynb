    "Decision-making is at the core of everything we do in life. It's an activity that happens all the time, whether we realize it or not. This process is deeply embedded in our human biology, guiding us through both conscious choices, like what car to purchase, and unconscious ones, like reflexively pulling our hand away from a hot surface. Every decision we make, big or small, plays a role in helping us navigate the world and stay safe. Without this constant decision-making, our ability to survive and thrive would be greatly diminished. Therefore, as you can imagine decision-making is profound in differentiating in successful people. \n",

    "**Decision-making ability is regarded by executives as one of the most highly desired business skills!** Most people (even business professionals) make decisions using simple intuition. However, when the problem is sufficiently important, the chance of making a mistake is high or the decision outcome stakes are high; it is important to apply Decision Intelligence principles to solve those problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To most people, consistently making quality decisions can be a daunting task. There is good news though! It has been shown that in the same way with the training of top-tier athletes, decision-makers can employ techniques, plans, and instruments to improve with practice. This can include:  \n",
    "* Framing a decision from different points of view   \n",
    "* Gathering intelligence and information to reason over a decision  \n",
    "* Executing a decision - using a proven framework, performing calculations  \n",
    "* Making a decision alone or with a group  \n",
    "* Communicating a decision effectively to various stakeholders  \n",
    "* Monitoring a decision for potential optimization  \n",

    "Decision Intelligence sounds interesting, but what does this have todo with Generative AI? Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities possess potential for enhancing decision-making processes through advanced reasoning abilities. These GenAI LLMs have been trained on complex data sets with logic, patterns, writing source (programming) code and problem solving in mind. This allows LLMs to simulate human-like reasoning, offering insights and recommendations based on comprehensive data analysis. So what does this all mean? **This means that all of the historical use of decision-making, problem-solving, mental models, decision huersistics can be appllied to LLMs with GenAI and help humans make decisions!**  \n",

    "As you can imagine there has been much study, thought and literature written on decision-making. There are examples and resources provided below to immerse yourself into the paradigm. Therefore, this workshop isn't meant to be a full introduction Decision Intelligence or decision-making, but will be used as the context for the GenAI exercises seen throughout. It is meant to show how you \"realistically\" can make decisions with AI & GenAI and not just apply simple prompt techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking *\"Do I need to read a ton of decision-making literature before getting started with the workshop?\"* Not necessarily. The workshop will introduce specific Decision Intelligence topics and showcase how they can be unlocked with GenAI. In a perfect scenario, this workshop would introduce cognitive behaviour in humans and many topics that are dependent on decision-making. However, in order to make progress, the workshop has to start somewhere pragmatic. The workshop will showcase human intuition, but quickly move onto decision-framing, decision-making, quantitative frameworks and decision communication practices. This is where most of the GenAI workshop content will be applied.   "
