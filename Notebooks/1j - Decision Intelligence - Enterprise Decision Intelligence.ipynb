    "Implementing decision-making systems in an enterprise is really about making decisions repeatable, explainable, and scalable. What does this mean? This essentially means taking the Decision Intelligence process introduced in the previous modules and making that process available and scalable to your users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to organize organizational decision work is to recognize there are two main kinds of enterprise decision systems: systems that support human decision-makers and systems that manage decisions by automating them. A decision support system (DSS) is designed to improve decision-making by evaluating the decision solution, running through a decision process and making a recommendation to a decision maker. The actual decision execution is up to the decision-maker. A decision management system (DMS), in contrast, focuses on processing automated decision-making, and it explicitly differs from DSS by aiming to automate the decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSS and DMS systems are both important when operationalizing Decision Intelligence in an organization. Most companies deploy both in conjunction and rarely do you find only one type of system in a large organization. In a simple example, high-stakes decisions where human subject matter experts need to execute the final decision are typically implemented as decision support systems (DSS). Conversely, highly repetitive decisions that are lower risk will typically be automated wih a decision management system (DMS). "

    "Decision Support Systems are designed to support decision-making by helping organizations execute Decision Intelligence recommendation processes. In practice, they’re often deployed as a separate system outside the organization’s core business environment, functioning as an adjacent layer that teams can consult when they need decision clarity. A DSS typically focuses on producing “current state” framing, intelligence gathering and proposing decision options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because DSS tools emphasize informing rather than enforcing, policies, regulations, and best practices remain the responsibility of the expert user. The system provides the inputs and visibility, but people must apply their judgment, domain expertise, and governance rules themselves. As a result, human users are expected to learn how to use the support system information effectively, including interpreting outputs correctly, validating assumptions, and translating insights into action.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DSS is most valuable when it’s treated as an augmentation of expert judgment, not a replacement for it. The system can surface patterns, uncertainties, and scenario outcomes, but the policies, regulations, and best practices that govern what should be done typically remain the responsibility of the decision maker (or the team) interpreting the output. That means organizations often invest in user training and decision workflows so people learn to read the system’s information efficiently—understanding assumptions, checking data quality, and translating “here’s the situation” into “here’s the right action,” given the organization’s constraints and responsibilities."

    "Decision Management Systems (DMS) are designed to manage and operationalize decision-making by embedding decision logic directly into business workflows. They often combinine business rules with analytics and artificial intelligence to determine the most appropriate action in a process. In practice, a DMS is used to model, manage, and automate repeatable business decisions so decisions can be executed consistently and quickly at scale, with software making (or strongly recommending) the decision rather than leaving it solely to a human in the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because DMS tools emphasize execution, governance, policies, regulations, best practices they typically synthesize the decison workflow into the business processes. This enables explicit decision logic (often packaged as “decision services”) that can be invoked by enterprise applications. This approach treats decision logic as a managed asset: organizations can author and run decision services, keep decision-making accessible to applications, and manage business logic more independently from surrounding systems. In properly designed DMS implementations, the decision logic is meant to be easier to find and change when policies or regulations shift without sacrificing compliance. This is natural as the decisioning is designed to be transparent and traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DMS can also go beyond describing the “current state” by enhancing it with a recommended action (the decision), effectively connecting insight to execution. Importantly, policies, regulations, and best practices are built into the decision workflow process, so governance is embedded rather than left entirely to user interpretation. Finally, learning is built into the core of the system, allowing it to actively improve over time—refining decision rules, adapting to new data, and strengthening outcomes as conditions change."
