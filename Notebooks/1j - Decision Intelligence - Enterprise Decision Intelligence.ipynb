    "Implementing decision-making systems in an enterprise is really about making decisions repeatable, explainable, and scalable. What does this mean? This essentially means taking the Decision Intelligence process introduced in the previous modules and making that process available and scalable to your users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to organize organizational decision work is to recognize there are two main kinds of enterprise decision systems: systems that support human decision-makers and systems that manage decisions by automating them. A decision support system (DSS) is designed to improve decision-making by evaluating the decision solution, running through a decision process and making a recommendation to a decision maker. The actual decision execution is up to the decision-maker. A decision management system (DMS), in contrast, focuses on processing automated decision-making, and it explicitly differs from DSS by aiming to automate the decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "DSS and DMS systems are both important when operationalizing Decision Intelligence in an organization. Most companies deploy both in conjunction and rarely do you find only one type of system in a large organization. In a simple example, high-stakes decisions where human subject matter experts need to execute the final decision are typically implemented as decision support systems (DSS). Conversely, highly repetitive decisions that are lower risk will typically be automated wih a decision management system (DMS). "
