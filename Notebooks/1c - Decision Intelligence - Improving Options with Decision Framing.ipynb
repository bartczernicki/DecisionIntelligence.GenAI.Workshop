    "**Decision framing is about presenting or thinking about choices when making a decision.** Imagine you are trying to decide whether to take a new job offer. Like any job, this specific job has it's own pros and cons. One of the biggest pros is a high salary. Conversely, the biggest con is the potentially long commute and office work policy. If you focus on the higher salary and exciting new opportunities, you might feel more positive about the move. But if you think about the longer commute and the risk of not liking your new coworkers, you might feel hesitant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way you \"frame\" the decision can greatly influence what you decide. It's like looking at the same picture through different lenses: each lens highlights different parts and colors, changing your overall view. By being aware of how you're framing a decision, you can create more optimized paths on how to approach a decision. Furthermore, decision-framing can also help you uncover more decision choices. Going back to the example above on taking a high-paying job with a potentially long commute. Considering all the options may allow you to frame your decision conditionally. For example, you may only consider accepting this job if the option presents itself to work a hybrid schedule from home.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several decision-framing techniques, processes and frameworks that can be applied to improve decision-framing such as: Pareto Analysis, the 10-10-10 rule, Pascal's Wager, the Six Thinking Hats etc. **The good news is that these decision-framing techniques are either built-in to the GenAI model or the model can be provided (\"grounded\") with new decision-framing techniques.**"

    "Realistically there can be multiple decision-frames in a complex decision. The image below illustrates the **Six Thinking Hats** decision-framing technique, which approaches a decision problem from 6 different perspectives. Each \"thinking hat\" looks at the problem in its own way. For example, the green hat looks at the problem from a \"Creative perspective\". You will see examples in this workshop how this technique can easily be applied to Generative AI decision-making, allowing the GenAI model to recommend a path forward in that specific contextual framing.  \n",
