       "   - Capture daily routine (sleep schedule, charging habits), primary activities (running, weightlifting), phone OS, wrist size, and aesthetic preferences.\n",
       "3. Use a structured trade-off framework\n",
       "   - Present a compact multi-criteria comparison (rank or score options across battery, sleep accuracy, sensors, price, app, comfort).\n",
       "4. Narrow options with progressive filtering\n",
       "   - Start broad, then filter by constraints (e.g., battery >7 days → show 3–4 best matches) to avoid overload.\n",
       "5. Make trade-offs explicit and quantitative\n",
       "   - Translate features into expected outcomes (e.g., “Expect ~7–10 days battery with moderate use; enabling continuous SpO2 reduces this by ~20%”).\n",
       "6. Recommend small experiments before committing\n",
       "   - Suggest trialing devices (return policies), wearing a temporary band to test comfort, or comparing sleep data side-by-side for a few nights.\n",
       "7. Provide decision checkpoints and action steps\n",
       "   - Offer a short checklist for purchase, setup, and a 2-week evaluation plan to decide whether to keep or return.\n",
       "\n",
       "Considerations for the AI to help make better decisions\n",
       "- Personalization: tailor recommendations by learning preferences (budget, phone OS, activity types) and behavior (charging habits, tolerance for false positives).\n",
       "- Preference elicitation: use simple, guided questions or sliders to quantify trade-offs and produce ranked options automatically.\n",
       "- Transparency & uncertainty: state confidence levels, typical variability (accuracy ranges), and cite sources or manufacturer specs where relevant.\n",
       "- Comparative scoring & sensitivity analysis: show how recommendations change if the user adjusts a priority (e.g., increase importance of sleep accuracy from medium to high).\n",
       "- Scenario simulation: outline likely daily routines (charging schedule, sleep-tracking continuity) for each device to show practical impacts.\n",
       "- Evidence & limitations: flag that trackers are not medical devices, summarize common accuracy limitations (wrist placement, movement, skin tone, arrhythmias), and suggest when to seek clinical evaluation.\n",
       "- Actionable next steps: give an explicit small plan (purchase + 2-week trial + data checks + return deadline) and what metrics to watch (sleep score trends, battery drain).\n",
       "- Privacy & data handling: remind users to review vendor privacy policies and discuss what data syncs to cloud/third parties.\n",
       "- User control & explainability: offer plain-language explanations of how metrics are derived (HR variability → sleep stage inference) and how to interpret them.\n",
       "- Practical supports: propose band-fit tips, charging routines, third-party apps or integrations, and accessories to improve experience.\n",

       "If you want, I can:\n",
       "- Create a short prioritized checklist (must-haves vs nice-to-haves) for you to confirm.\n",
       "- Build a simple scoring table comparing 3–4 specific models (Inspire 3, Charge 5, Vivosmart 5, Mi Band 7) against your priorities."
