This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques within Microsoft AI Extensions. If you’ve used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’re already familiar with prompting: given an instruction, a language model predicts the most likely and relevant response. With Microsoft AI Extensions, you can build applications, services, and APIs that execute these prompts quickly and effectively. \n",

        "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal is to maximize the quality and clarity of the AI’s output, often by using specific wording, added context, or concrete examples within the prompt. \n",

        "By combining Decision Intelligence with Prompt Engineering/Context Engineering, you can create **“Decision Intelligence powered by Generative AI”**. This approach leverages Generative AI models to apply decision-making pricingples, by reasoning through complex decision scenarios, gathering intelligence, recommending decisions, and communicating results more effectively.
