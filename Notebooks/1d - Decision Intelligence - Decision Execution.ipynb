    "After all the options have been properly framed and intelligence has been gathered on each, the third step in the Decision Intelligence Framework is **Decision Execution**. This is the critical part of the process where an individual, team or an organization arrive at a conclusion and then proceed to make that conclusion actionable. Basically, the chosen options are converted into concrete actions, resource commitments, and observable outcomes. This sounds very fancy, but Decision Execution can be as simple as selecting a dinner option from a menu and enjoying the meal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simple form Decision Execution is selecting from options. However, Decision Execution can take many interesting forms. For example, not selecting any of the options or not doing anything is a form of decision execution. A more sophisticated example of this is \"quitting\" or \"quitting early\". Annie Duke dedicates an entire book to this form of decision execution (linked in the modules). In her book, Annie Duke illustrates that optimal execution sometimes means stopping (quitting) rather than starting. "
