    "After all the options have been properly framed and intelligence has been gathered on each, the third step in the Decision Intelligence Framework is **Decision Execution**. This is the critical part of the process where an individual, team or an organization arrive at a conclusion and then proceed to make that conclusion actionable. Basically, the chosen options are converted into concrete actions, resource commitments, and observable outcomes. This sounds very fancy, but Decision Execution can be as simple as selecting a dinner option from a menu and enjoying the meal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest form Decision Execution is selecting from options. Most of these decisions are executed subsconsiously without much thought. For example, selecting an apple to eat from a basket of apples. The decision execution is simple and happens fast. However, Decision Execution can take many interesting forms. For example, not selecting any of the options or not doing anything is a form of decision execution. A more sophisticated example of this is \"quitting\" or \"quitting early\". Annie Duke dedicates an entire book to this form of decision execution (linked in the modules). In her book, Annie Duke illustrates that optimal execution sometimes means stopping (quitting) rather than starting. "

    "Great approaches to decisions are only half the battle. Real value shows up when you optimize the decision execution process. Let's take a quick look why optimizing Decision Execution is important: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good Plans Die in Execution:** Research shows that about two-thirds of company strategies never pay off because people struggle to turn slides into action. \n",
    "* **Speed Beats Perfect in a Fast World:** Firms that can decide and act quickly grow faster and earn more profit than slower rivals. Individuals that can decide effectively are much likely to progress faster in multiple tasks, and are also less likely to procrastinate. \n",
    "* **Having the Right Tools to Execute Decisions:** Once you have the proper framing and gathered the intelligence, you need proper Decision Execution tools to be able to make decisions actionable. For example, if you have gathered the most perfect intelligence on your competition, not having the right analytical or AI tools will not help you optimize execution. \n",
    "* **Scaling Decisions:** Big decisions typically involve multiple teams and moving parts. Strong execution ensures all those pieces work in sync and are coordinated appropriately. \n",
    "* **Explaining the Decision Execution aids in Tranperancy:** Decisions that can be explained in why and how they will be executed allows everyone in the decision-making process to operate on the same level of information.  \n",
