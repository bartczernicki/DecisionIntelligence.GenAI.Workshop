    "After all the options have been properly framed and intelligence has been gathered on each, the third step in the Decision Intelligence Framework is **Decision Execution**. This is the critical part of the process where an individual, team or an organization arrive at a conclusion and then proceed to make that conclusion actionable. Basically, the chosen options are converted into concrete actions, resource commitments, and observable outcomes. This sounds very fancy, but Decision Execution can be as simple as selecting a dinner option from a menu and enjoying the meal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest form Decision Execution is selecting from options. Most of these decisions are executed subsconsiously without much thought. For example, selecting an apple to eat from a basket of apples. The decision execution is simple and happens fast. However, Decision Execution can take many interesting forms. For example, not selecting any of the options or not doing anything is a form of decision execution. A more sophisticated example of this is \"quitting\" or \"quitting early\". Annie Duke dedicates an entire book to this form of decision execution (linked in the modules). In her book, Annie Duke illustrates that optimal execution sometimes means stopping (quitting) rather than starting.\n",

    "> üì∞ **\"Do Nothing\" Heinz Strategic Decision Execution:** In 2010 the ‚Äúcorn-syrup scare‚Äù hit U.S. grocery aisles. ConAgra reformulated every bottle of Hunt‚Äôs, trumpeting a new recipe sweetened only with cane sugar. Heinz debated whether it, too, should rip the high-fructose corn syrup out of its proven ketchup formula, but consumer testing showed shoppers were perfectly happy with the taste they already knew. So Heinz chose a minimal response: keep the flagship ketchup formula exactly the same and quietly launch a small off-shoot called ‚ÄúSimply Heinz,‚Äù which used sugar for the minority that really cared, while it focused its effort (and ad dollars) on new packs like the Dip & Squeeze pouch. The outcome vindicated the ‚ÄúDo Nothing\" strategy. What happened? Sales of Hunt‚Äôs sugar-only ketchup stalled so badly that ConAgra put corn syrup back less than two years later, while Heinz retained its dominant share without ever tampering with the taste most consumers expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, not all Decision Execution is done on our own behalf or on the behalf of the organization we are part of. Sometimes, we recommend a Decision Execution path for someone else or another entity. For example, when you plan for retirement, a financial planner will gather intelligence about your financial goals and provide several options. These financial planning options are essentially Decision Execution plans that the family can then implement (make actionable). "

    "Great approaches to decisions are only half the battle. Real value shows up when you optimize the decision execution process. Let's take a quick look why optimizing Decision Execution is important: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good Plans Die in Execution:** Research shows that about two-thirds of company strategies never pay off because people struggle to turn slides into action. \n",
    "* **Speed Beats Perfect in a Fast World:** Firms that can decide and act quickly grow faster and earn more profit than slower rivals. Individuals that can decide effectively are much likely to progress faster in multiple tasks, and are also less likely to procrastinate. \n",
    "* **Having the Right Tools to Execute Decisions:** Once you have the proper framing and gathered the intelligence, you need proper Decision Execution tools to be able to make decisions actionable. For example, if you have gathered the most perfect intelligence on your competition, not having the right analytical or AI tools will not help you optimize execution. \n",
    "* **Scaling Decisions:** Big decisions typically involve multiple teams and moving parts. Strong execution ensures all those pieces work in sync and are coordinated appropriately. \n",
    "* **Explaining the Decision Execution aids in Tranperancy:** Decisions that can be explained in why and how they will be executed allows everyone in the decision-making process to operate on the same level of information.  \n",
