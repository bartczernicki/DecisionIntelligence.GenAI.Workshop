      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- Tangible asset, may appreciate over time.\n",
      "- Generates regular cash flow from rentals.\n",
      "- Leverage: can use mortgage to amplify returns (with risks).\n",

      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- Illiquid: hard to quickly sell if you need cash.\n",
      "- Requires active management (tenants, maintenance, vacancies).\n",

      "- **Combination** protects against the unknown, as Franklin advised: “An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest”—spread risk, keep learning, and reassess annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like to see a numeric scenario comparison to visualize possible outcomes over 10–20 years?\n",

This blended approach optimizes long-term financial growth and mitigates risk by not overexposing you to any single asset class, aligns with your goals, and provides both stability and growth potential.\n",
