       "- **Guided Needs Assessment:** Early in the conversation, have the AI use clarifying questions (e.g., “What’s your budget?”, “Is water resistance important?”, “Do you want notifications or GPS?”) to identify all relevant priorities.\n",
       "- **Feature Prioritization:** Help the user explicitly rank their desired features (e.g., “Rate battery life, sleep tracking, price, notifications, etc., from most to least important.”).\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Comparative Analysis**\n",
       "- **Comparison Tables:** Present a side-by-side table of shortlisted models with scores or ticks for each user-prioritized feature.\n",

       "\n",
       "**3. Personalization & Context**\n",
       "- **Lifestyle Integration:** Ask questions about the user’s daily routine, exercise habits, and phone ecosystem for better recommendations.\n",
       "- **Scenario Planning:** Offer short “what-if” scenarios (e.g., “If you start training for a race, would you need built-in GPS?”).\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Transparent Reasoning**\n",
       "- **Rationale Explanation:** Explain why certain models are recommended over others, relating directly to the user’s stated preferences.\n",
       "- **Highlight Limitations:** Proactively mention limitations (such as paywalls for advanced features or potential syncing issues).\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Decision Confidence**\n",
       "- **Recap & Next Steps:** End with a concise summary of options and clear action steps (e.g., “Would you like setup advice or a guide on using sleep data?”).\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Continuous Learning**\n",
       "- **Feedback Loop:** Prompt the user for feedback on the advice or follow-up questions to iteratively refine recommendations.\n",
