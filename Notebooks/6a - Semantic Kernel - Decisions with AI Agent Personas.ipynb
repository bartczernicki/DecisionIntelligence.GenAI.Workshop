      "• Quadrant III (Delegate):  \n",

      "### Key Areas to Consider Before Buying a New Car:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Define Your Objectives**\n",
      "   - **Purpose**: Why are you buying this car? Is it for commuting, family use, long trips, status, or utility (e.g., carrying tools or equipment)?\n",
      "   - **Budget**: What is your total budget, including upfront costs, monthly payments, maintenance, insurance, and fuel costs?\n",
      "   - **Future Needs**: Will this car reliably serve your needs in 3–5 years, as your lifestyle or responsibilities evolve?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Identify Constraints**\n",
      "   - **Financial**: What portion of your monthly income can you allot to car-related expenses? Will this purchase affect savings or debt repayment plans?\n",
      "   - **Space**: Do you need a compact car for urban parking or a larger vehicle for transporting family/equipment?\n",
      "   - **Infrastructure**: If you're considering an electric vehicle, do you have access to charging stations?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Research Vehicle Types and Options**\n",
      "   - Compare options such as sedans, SUVs, trucks, electric/hybrid vehicles, or luxury models based on your objectives.\n",
      "   - Evaluate new vs. pre-owned cars. A pre-owned car may provide better value if depreciation is a concern.\n",
      "   - Consider brands known for reliability, fuel efficiency, and resale value.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Prioritize Criteria Using the Eisenhower Matrix**\n",
      "Let’s categorize the considerations into urgent and important factors to assess what must guide your decision-making.\n",
      "\n",

      "| **Important**                        | **Not Important**                    |\n",
      "| **DO FIRST**                         | **SCHEDULE**                         |\n",
      "| Secure financing or loan             | Compare insurance costs              |\n",
      "| Research cars in your budget         | Test-drive multiple models           |\n",

      "#### Explanation of the Eisenhower Matrix:\n",
      "- **Do First**: Financial planning, vehicle type decisions, and initial research are critical steps to start immediately.\n",
      "- **Schedule**: Activities like test-driving multiple models and evaluating long-term reliability can be planned once your short-list is ready.\n",
      "- **Delegate**: Certain administrative tasks (vehicle registration, external reviews) can be handed off to experts or completed online.\n",
      "- **Eliminate**: Stay clear of making decisions based on visual appeal, luxury features you don’t need, or marketing hype without value.\n",

      "#### Step 1: Establish Budget\n",
      "- **Immediate Costs**: Down payment, taxes, and fees.\n",
      "- **Long-Term Costs**: Monthly payments, insurance, fuel/electricity costs, maintenance, and depreciation.\n",
      "- Rule of thumb: Car-related expenses shouldn't exceed 15–20% of your monthly net income.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Research and Shortlist\n",
      "- Use a criteria spreadsheet to evaluate options: factors like budget, fuel efficiency, reliability ratings, resale value, and comfort.\n",
      "- Include external reviews and safety ratings.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Test Drive and Inspect\n",
      "- Narrow your choices down to 2–3 models and test-drive them.\n",
      "- Check for comfort, noise level, handling, and features.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Evaluate Financing Options\n",
      "- Compare loan interest rates, dealership financing, or leasing options.\n",
      "- Assess if cash purchase or loan benefits you more in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 5: Negotiate Price\n",
      "- Research the car’s market value and incentives like rebates.\n",
      "- Negotiate with the dealership for extras like free servicing, warranties, or discounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 6: Double-Check Insurance Premiums\n",
      "- Get insurance quotes for your shortlisted cars to avoid surprises in premium costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 7: Review Long-Term Implications\n",
      "- How does the car align with your lifestyle and financial goals?\n",
      "- Will the car be easy to maintain or resell?\n",

      "3. **Resilience**: Can this car handle future uncertainties (e.g., rising fuel costs or changing commuting patterns)?\n",
