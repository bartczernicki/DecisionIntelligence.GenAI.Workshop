    "Agent personas can leverage the Chat Completion service from the Semantic Kernel Agents package. Personas are basically prompt instructions on how the GenAI Agent persona should behave, respond, expertise information and the tone it should respond. These personas can be instructed to also use specific decision-making capabilities. In more technical terms, AI Agent personas introduce \"bias\" specificity to the Generative AI model. This is a very powerful concept in Generative AI as it can simulate human-like biases in personas and expertise, which is an everyday occurance in decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The term **bias** in statistics, machine learning and AI is not a \"bad\" word. Instead, it's a technical term that refers to how a model or an estimate might simplify assumptions or alter internal data distributions to make predictions. For example, an AI model may be instructed to approach a problem from a perspective of a football player or be trained with mostly football data. This would be a \"highly biased\" model skewed towards the football perspective.  \n",

    "In this example, the agent will take on the persona of **Dwight Eisenhower**. What does Dwight Eisenhower have todo with Decision Intelligence? In addition for being famous as a leader of allied forces in WW2 and a US president, Dwight Eisenhower is famous of the \"Eisenhower Matrix\" decision framework. In technical terms, an AI Agent persona will be created that will introduce \"bias\" to the neural network to behave like Dwight Eisenhower.  \n",
