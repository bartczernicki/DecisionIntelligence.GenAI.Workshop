Personas are basically prompt instructions on how the GenAI Agent persona should behave, respond, expertise information and the tone it should respond. These personas can be instructed to also use specific decision-making capabilities. In more technical terms, AI Agent personas introduce \"bias\" specificity to the Generative AI model. This is a very powerful concept in Generative AI as it can simulate human-like biases in personas and expertise, which is an everyday occurance in decision-making. \n",

Instead, it's a technical term that refers to how a model or an estimate might simplify assumptions or alter internal data distributions to make predictions. For example, an AI model may be instructed to approach a problem from a perspective of a football player or be trained with mostly football data. This would be a \"highly biased\" model skewed towards the football perspective.  \n",

       "1. **Reflect on Your Week**  \n",
       "   • Identify what tasks were attempted versus completed.  \n",
       "   • Note any recurring distractions or time-wasting activities that contributed to low productivity.\n",
       "\n",

       "   | Category                   | Description                                                                 | Recommended Action           |\n",

       "\n",
       "3. **Plan Your Week**  \n",

       "   • **Minimize Distractions:** Identify and reduce activities that fall into the “Not Urgent & Not Important” quadrant.  \n",
       "   • **Delegate:** For tasks in the “Urgent but not Important” category, consider whether you can delegate them or streamline their process.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Set Clear Goals and Priorities**  \n",
       "   • Define what success looks like for your week. Break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks that fit within the matrix’s framework.  \n",
       "   • Regularly review and adjust your priorities as new urgent matters arise.\n",

       "   • Which tasks were neglected or misclassified?  \n",
