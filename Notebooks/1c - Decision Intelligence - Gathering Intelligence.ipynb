    "Now that framing a decision has been explored, the next step lies in gathering the appropriate intelligence to inform decisions. Traditionally, this step can be overwhelmingâ€”sifting through vast amounts of data and battling information overload. The **Gathering Intelligence** step is a comprehensive process of not only coalescing raw data but also transforming it into high-value information through analytical methods. It involves evaluating risks, identifying patterns, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights. By doing so, it helps you understand the situation completely by revealing all relevant factors and their interconnections. This enhanced information is crucial for making informed and effective decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is gathering intelligence so vital in decision-making? Because the quality of decisions is only as good as the information you base them on. Think about trying to navigate a new city without a map; you might eventually reach your destination, but not without unnecessary detours and delays. Similarly, without thorough quality intelligence, decisions can be non-optimied, leading to unintended consequences. Gathering comprehensive intelligence reduces uncertainty, uncovers hidden opportunities, and provides a solid foundation for evaluating options. In essence, it transforms guesswork into an quantitative strategy, empowering you to make choices with greater confidence backed by information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the many ways people have collected and shared information over time. Throughout history, humans have gathered intelligence through various meansâ€”stories told around campfires, handwritten manuscripts, printed books, and newspapers. Each of these methods represented a leap in how information was shared and preserved. However, access to this intelligence was often limited. For centuries, only the wealthy could afford books or had the literacy skills to read them, while the majority relied on oral traditions or had minimal access to written knowledge. Even as the internet emerged, bridging information gaps, it wasn't until recently that technology became widespread enough to truly democratize access. Let's take a look at two illustrative examples.

    "As a historical example, consider the tale of King Alfred the Great of Wessex during the 9th century. Facing the threat of Viking invasions, Alfred's kingdom was teetering on the brink of collapse. Instead of charging into battle uninformed, he chose a cunning approachâ€”disguising himself as a wandering minstrel to infiltrate the Viking camps. Through this daring act, he gathered invaluable intelligence about the enemy's strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Armed with this insight, Alfred was able to devise a surprise attack that culminated in the decisive Battle of Edington. This victory not only turned the tide against the Vikings but also laid the foundation for the unification of England. Alfred's story illustrates how astute intelligence gathering can empower leaders to make pivotal decisions that alter the course of history.\n",
    "\n",
    "This story continued to \"live\" by being passed down through many generations (even perhaps changed and embelished) as folklore, stories and songs to throughout the years. People would \"gather intelligence\" by assembling together and share the wisdom they have gained themselves. This was the way most of our human intelligence has been passed down for thousands of years. Eventually humans devised ways to scale communication primarily through writing and reading. Stories like this were persisted many times in books for many to \"gather intelligence\" from in the future!  "

    "Access to information has always been crucial for making good decisions. In the past, only the wealthy had easy access to valuable information. They could afford to build large personal libraries filled with expensive books and encyclopedias or hire researchers and advisors to gather and interpret information for them. Business executives had the privilege of using early cell phones and specialized devices to get real-time data, giving them a significant advantage in decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most people, accessing timely and relevant information was challenging. They relied on outdated books, limited public resources, or second-hand information. This lack of access made it hard for them to make informed decisions and limited their opportunities for personal and professional growth. The internet changed everything! Suddenly, anyone with an internet connection could access a vast amount of information instantly. Online search engines replaced the need for physical encyclopedias. News that once took days or weeks to reach people could now be accessed immediately from anywhere in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of smartphones and mobile devices made this even more impactful. Now, access to real-time information like stock market updates, breaking news, and social media trends is literally in our pockets. Entrepreneurs can conduct market research without large budgets, students can access educational resources beyond their school libraries, and everyday individuals can stay informed about global events as they happen. This has empowered people from all walks of life to gather intelligence that was once pragmatically out of reach. \n",

    "Before diving into **Gathering Intelligence** using Generative AI, let's define where that intelligence can be sourced from by Generative AI systems. Generative AI systems typically Gather Intelligence from three key areas:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training Data:** This is the curated data that was used to train the LLM (large language model). The larger the model and the more parameters highly correlates to more \"intelligence\" the model poses. This is why larger models with a very large amount of parameters (over ~100 billion) will typically have broader knowledge over small models (under ~10 billion). Generative AI models auto-magically gather intelligence from their internal weights and biases, based on the input prompt and configuration.  \n",
    "* **Knowledge (Grounding) Sources:** When the curated training data is not enough or doesn't provide the specific information required, knowledge stores can be used with a RAG (retrieveal augmented generation) design patterns. This can provide very specific information tailored to faciliate the instructions in a prompt. These knowledge stores can be almost anything: internet search results, indexed documents, analysis frameworks, machine learning models etc. While these knowledge stores can source almost infinite about of data or information, Generative AI systems need to be very specific on what is presented to the Generative AI model to fit into it's operating contenxt window. This is why the concept of \"intelligence\" is so important, as highly specific and high impact intelligence needs to be presented not just vast amounts of data. \n",
    "* **Memory:** While interacting with the Generative AI model; users provide various text, data, key pieces of information etc. Similar to how humans learn and internalize life experiences, Generative AI models can have their own \"memory\". The more interactions users have with a model for a specific task (decision-making) the more memory of those interactions is created between the user and the specific Generative AI system. For example, passing in chat history interactions can help the Generative AI system use that as a short-term or long-term memory for gathering intelligence.  "

    "Generative AI is revolutionizing the way we gather intelligence by not only automating the collection process but also enhancing the quality and relevance of the information obtained. Instead of manually sifting through vast amounts of data, Generative AI can quickly scan, retrieve, and organize pertinent information from diverse sources. This automation saves valuable time and reduces the risk of overlooking critical data that could influence a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of Generative AI lies in its ability to distill and analyze the gathered information. It doesn't just collect dataâ€”it interprets it, identifies patterns, and extracts key insights essential for making informed decisions. For example, Generative AI can summarize lengthy reports, highlight significant trends, and even predict potential outcomes based on historical data. Crucially, it can surface high-impact information that might otherwise be buried within massive datasets, bringing the most critical factors to the forefront.\n",
