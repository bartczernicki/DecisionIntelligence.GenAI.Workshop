    "[**\"Winning Decisions: Getting It Right the First Time\"**](https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Decisions-Getting-Right-First/dp/0385502257) by J. Edward Russo and Paul J.H. Schoemaker explores how to make effective decisions from the outset. The authors emphasize the importance of decision framing, which involves defining the context and boundaries of a decision before making it. Proper framing ensures that the right problems are addressed and helps avoid common decision-making pitfalls. The book outlines techniques for gathering relevant information, considering various options, and using structured processes to arrive at sound conclusions. Russo and Schoemaker use real-world examples to illustrate how clear and precise framing can lead to better outcomes. They stress that good decision-making involves both rational analysis and intuitive judgment, and provide strategies to integrate these aspects effectively. Overall, the book aims to equip readers with the tools to make well-informed decisions that are correct the first time."
