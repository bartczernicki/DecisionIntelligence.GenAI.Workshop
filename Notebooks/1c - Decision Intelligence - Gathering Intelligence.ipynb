    "Now that framing a decision has been explored, the next step lies in gathering the appropriate intelligence to inform decisions. Traditionally, this step can be overwhelming, sifting through vast amounts of data and battling information overload. The **Gathering Intelligence** step is a comprehensive process of not only coalescing raw data but also transforming it into high-value information through analytical methods. It involves evaluating risks, identifying patterns, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights. By doing so, it helps you understand the situation completely by revealing all relevant factors and their interconnections. This enhanced information is crucial for making informed and effective decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is gathering intelligence so vital in decision-making? Because the quality of decisions is only as good as the information you base them on. Think about trying to navigate a new city without a map; you might eventually reach your destination, but not without unnecessary detours and delays. Similarly, without thorough quality intelligence, decisions can be non-optimied, leading to unintended consequences. Gathering comprehensive intelligence reduces uncertainty, uncovers hidden opportunities, and provides a solid foundation for evaluating options. In essence, it transforms guesswork into an quantitative strategy, empowering you to make choices with greater confidence backed by information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small amounts of valid intelligence, reduces the uncertainty exponentially. If you know nothing about the environment that you are entering to make a decision, even small amounts of signals, empirical information, past results will dramatically improve your decision posture. Instead of relying on gut feel or incomplete narratives, decisions become anchored in evidence and updated as new information arrives. What is interesting is that gathering more intelligence comes at a cost, and as you do more of it the value of that intelligence decreases. What does this mean? There is a certain inflection point of intelligence value vs the intelligence gathering cost, where you may consider stopping and move on to executing the decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graphic below highlights the relationship between uncertainty and gathered intelligence. Notice the initial deep drop in uncertainty with the initial gathered intelligence. This means that the eary intelligence gathered yields the most reduction in uncertainty, because even a small amount of credible information can quickly eliminate the most plausible unknowns. As additional intelligence is collected, the curve begins to flatten, reflecting diminishing returns. Each additive data point still helps, but it tends to refine the picture rather than redefine it. Translating this to real-world use, early intelligence gathering and validation tend to deliver the biggest payoff, while later-stage collection is best aimed at closing specific gaps and testing key assumptions.  \n",

    "> 📝 Note: There are instances where seemingly completely uncertain processes can have explicit known outcomes that can be predicted. For example, to most of us flipping a fair coin is random and that deciding on the outcome feels arbitrary. It is considered so random, that most people consider this a 50/50 bet. However, because the act of flipping a coin happens in our world of physics we have much more potential information. In a controlled lab environment, scientists have demonstrated when they apply a certain force to a coin to flip it, they can calculate all the variables and confidently predict whether the coin will land heads or tails. In this specific scenario, scientists have close to \"perfect information\" and the coin flipping uncertainty is near zero. Therefore, it is easy to make an effecive quality decision of heads vs tails. Typically in the real-world we don't have access to perfect information or it is too expensive to attain. "

    "Let's look at the many ways people have collected and shared information over time. Throughout history, humans have gathered intelligence through various means—stories told around campfires, handwritten manuscripts, printed books, and newspapers. Each of these methods represented a leap in how information was shared and preserved. However, access to this intelligence was often limited. For centuries, only the wealthy could afford books or had the literacy skills to read them, while the majority relied on oral traditions or had minimal access to written knowledge. Even as the internet emerged, bridging information gaps, it wasn't until recently that technology became widespread enough to truly democratize access. Let's take a look at two illustrative examples.

    "\n",
    "As a historical example, consider the tale of King Alfred the Great of Wessex during the 9th century. Facing the threat of Viking invasions, Alfred's kingdom was teetering on the brink of collapse. Instead of charging into battle uninformed, he chose a different approach by disguising himself as a wandering minstrel to infiltrate the Viking camps. Through this daring act, he **gathered invaluable intelligence** about the enemy's strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Armed with this insight, King Alfred was able to devise a surprise attack that culminated in the decisive **Battle of Edington (Year of 878)**. This victory not only turned the tide against the Vikings but also laid the foundation for the unification of England. Alfred's story illustrates how gathering of intelligence can empower leaders to make pivotal decisions. In this case a decision that altered the course of history! \n",
    "\n",
    "This example of Gathering Intelligence is over 1,200 years old. What is even perhaps more interesting, is you might be learning about King Alfred just now. The story of King Alfred continued to \"live on\" by being passed down through many generations (even perhaps changed and embelished) as folklore, stories and songs. In those days, people would **\"Gather Intelligence\"** by assembling together and share the wisdom they have gained themselves. This was the way most of our human intelligence has been passed down for thousands of years. Eventually humans devised ways to scale communication primarily through writing and reading. Stories like this were persisted many times in books for many to \"gather intelligence\" from in the future! Now Artificial Intelligence models are being trained on these historical facts. "

    "Before diving into **Gathering Intelligence** using Generative AI, let's define where that intelligence can be sourced from by Generative AI systems. Generative AI systems typically Gather Intelligence from three key areas:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training Data:** This is the curated data that was used to train the LLM (large language model). The larger the model and the more parameters highly correlates to more \"intelligence\" the model poses. This is why larger models with a very large amount of parameters (over ~100 billion) will typically have broader knowledge over small models (under ~10 billion). Generative AI models auto-magically gather intelligence from their internal weights and biases, based on the input prompt and configuration. \n",
    "* **Knowledge (Grounding & Context Engineering) Sources:** When the curated training data is not enough or doesn't provide the specific information required, knowledge stores can be used with a RAG (retrieveal augmented generation) & context engineering design patterns. These patterns can provide very specific information tailored to faciliate the instructions in a prompt. Knowledge stores can be anything that persists valuable re-usable data/information: internet search results, indexed documents, analysis frameworks, machine learning models etc. While these knowledge stores can source almost infinite about of data or information, Generative AI systems need to be very specific on what is presented to the Generative AI model to fit into it's operating contenxt window. This is why the concept of \"intelligence\" is so important, as highly specific and high impact intelligence needs to be presented not just vast amounts of data. This selected \"intelligence\" is typically required to fit into a context window for an LLM. Therefore, you may hear the term \"context engineering\" used to describe optimizing the context windows for information.  \n",
    "* **Memory:** While interacting with the Generative AI model; users provide various text, data, key pieces of information etc. Similar to how humans learn and internalize life experiences, Generative AI models can have their own \"memory\". The more interactions users have with a model for a specific task (decision-making) the more memory of those interactions is created between the user and the specific Generative AI system. For example, passing in chat history interactions can help the Generative AI system use that as a short-term or long-term memory for gathering intelligence.  \n",

Schoemaker explores how to make effective decisions from the outset. The authors emphasize the importance of decision framing, which involves defining the context and boundaries of a decision before making it. Proper framing ensures that the right problems are addressed and helps avoid common decision-making pitfalls. The book outlines techniques for gathering relevant information, considering various options, and using structured processes to arrive at sound conclusions. Russo and Schoemaker use real-world examples to illustrate how clear and precise framing can lead to better outcomes. They stress that good decision-making involves both rational analysis and intuitive judgment, and provide strategies to integrate these aspects effectively. Overall, the book aims to equip readers with the tools to make well-informed decisions that are correct the first time.\n",
