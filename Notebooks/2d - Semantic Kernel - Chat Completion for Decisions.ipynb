      "3. **Decision Tree**:\n",
      "    - **Purpose**: To map out different possible outcomes of a decision and their associated probabilities.\n",

      "5. **Six Thinking Hats**:\n",
      "    - **Purpose**: To approach decision-making from multiple perspectives, fostering comprehensive analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. **SWOT Analysis**\n",
      "   - **Description**: SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis helps evaluate internal and external factors influencing a decision.\n",
      "   - **How to Use**:\n",
      "     - **Strengths**: Identify what advantages you have.\n",
      "     - **Weaknesses**: Recognize limitations or areas that need improvement.\n",
      "     - **Opportunities**: Explore external chances to grow or improve.\n",
      "     - **Threats**: Acknowledge external challenges that could hinder progress.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Useful for strategic planning and evaluating business initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Decision Matrix Analysis**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This framework helps in evaluating and prioritizing multiple options based on various criteria.\n",
      "   - **Steps**:\n",
      "     1. List options on one axis and criteria on the other.\n",
      "     2. Rate each option against the criteria.\n",
      "     3. Assign weights to each criterion based on importance.\n",
      "     4. Calculate a total score for each option to identify the best choice.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Ideal for situations with multiple alternatives and measurable criteria, such as product selection or vendor comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Vroom-Yetton Decision Model**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This model aids in determining the level of involvement employees should have in the decision-making process.\n",
      "   - **Steps**:\n",
      "     1. Assess the significance of the decision.\n",
      "     2. Evaluate the importance of team input and expertise.\n",
      "     3. Follow a decision tree to choose between autocratic, consultative, or group-based decision-making options.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Appropriate for leadership decisions and fostering teamwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: A systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives.\n",
      "   - **Steps**:\n",
      "     1. Identify the costs and benefits associated with each option.\n",
      "     2. Quantify and compare them.\n",
      "     3. Assess whether benefits outweigh costs and by how much.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Useful in project management, business investments, or public policy decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: A strategic decision-making model developed for fast-paced environments.\n",
      "   - **Steps**:\n",
      "     1. **Observe**: Gather information about the situation.\n",
      "     2. **Orient**: Analyze the information and your position in relation to the environment.\n",
      "     3. **Decide**: Formulate a plan based on the analysis.\n",
      "     4. **Act**: Implement the decision and monitor results.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Effective in crisis management, competitive strategy, and iterative processes.\n",
