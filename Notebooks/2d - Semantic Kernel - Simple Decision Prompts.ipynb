        "Prompts are the fundamental building blocks for eliciting effective responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques within Semantic Kernel. If you’ve used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’re already familiar with prompting: given an instruction, a language model predicts the most likely and relevant response. With Semantic Kernel, you can build applications, services, and APIs that execute these prompts.  \n",

        "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal is to maximize the quality and clarity of the AI’s output, often by using specific wording, added context, or concrete examples within the prompt.\n",

              "Based on the decision factors, **Alex should start at a community college**. This option provides the flexibility to explore her interests at a lower financial cost, reducing the risk of incurring significant student loan debt if she changes her major. While transferring to a four-year university later may require adjustment, Alex can still build a professional network and gain relevant experience during her final two years. This approach balances her academic uncertainty, financial concerns, and long-term career prospects effectively."
