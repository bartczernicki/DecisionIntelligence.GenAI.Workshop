    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

      "1. **SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)**\n",
      "   - **Description:** SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving an objective.\n",
      "   - **Support for Better Decision-Making:** By categorizing the factors into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, this framework helps decision-makers systematically analyze the internal and external environment. This balanced assessment facilitates informed choices by identifying what the organization is good at, where it can improve, what external opportunities to leverage, and what threats to mitigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision Matrix (or Prioritization Matrix)**\n",
      "   - **Description:** A decision matrix is a tool used to evaluate and prioritize a list of options, assigning weights to different criteria and scoring each option against these criteria.\n",
      "   - **Support for Better Decision-Making:** This framework allows for a quantitative comparison of multiple options by assigning numerical values to the criteria considered most important. This method supports a structured and objective evaluation, ensuring that the decision is based on balanced and comprehensive analysis rather than intuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**\n",
      "   - **Description:** CBA involves comparing the total expected costs versus the total expected benefits of one or more actions to choose the best or most profitable option.\n",
      "   - **Support for Better Decision-Making:** By monetizing the costs and benefits, this framework provides a clear view of the potential financial outcomes. It helps decision-makers evaluate whether the benefits of a decision outweigh the costs, thus supporting financially sound choices, particularly in business and policy-making scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Six Thinking Hats**\n",
      "   - **Description:** Developed by Edward de Bono, this method involves looking at a decision from six distinct perspectives (hats): factual, emotional, logistical, creative, positive, and negative.\n",
      "   - **Support for Better Decision-Making:** By deliberately adopting different viewpoints, this framework encourages comprehensive and diversified thinking. It helps in recognizing different aspects of the decision, such as data analysis (white hat), emotions and intuition (red hat), identifying risks (black hat), focusing on benefits (yellow hat), creativity (green hat), and process management (blue hat), leading to more holistic and balanced decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)**\n",
      "   - **Description:** Pareto Analysis is a technique that uses the Pareto Principle, suggesting that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes, to identify the most important factors in a decision.\n",
      "   - **Support for Better Decision-Making:** By focusing on the vital few factors that have the most significant impact, this framework helps prioritize efforts and resources effectively. It aids decision-makers in targeting the areas that will yield the most substantial improvements or benefits, thus enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.\n",

      "4. **The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix):**\n",
      "   - **Application:** Time management, prioritization, productivity\n",
      "   - **How it Helps:** This framework divides tasks into four quadrants based on urgency and importance. It assists in identifying the most crucial tasks that require immediate attention (urgent and important) and helps in delegating or postponing less critical activities. This improves efficiency and ensures focus on high-impact activities.\n",

      "Certainly! Here are five decision-making frameworks that can enhance the quality of decisions, along with brief descriptions of how each supports better analysis and reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: SWOT Analysis helps in identifying internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve an objective.\n",
      "   - **Support**: By systematically evaluating strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, this framework helps decision-makers understand the current situation comprehensively and develop strategies that leverage strengths and opportunities while mitigating weaknesses and threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision Matrix (or Weighted Scoring Model)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: A Decision Matrix involves listing options and criteria, assigning weights to each criterion based on importance, and scoring each option against each criterion.\n",
      "   - **Support**: This framework provides a quantitative approach to comparing multiple options based on different criteria, ensuring a balanced consideration of all relevant factors. It helps in prioritizing options that score highest overall, leading to more objective and transparent decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: CBA involves comparing the total expected costs of a decision against the total expected benefits to determine the best course of action.\n",
      "   - **Support**: By quantifying costs and benefits, this framework helps in evaluating the economic feasibility and potential return on investment of different options. It supports rational decision-making by highlighting the option with the greatest net benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: The OODA Loop is a cyclical decision-making process that emphasizes continuous observation, orientation, decision, and action.\n",
      "   - **Support**: This framework is particularly useful in dynamic and fast-changing environments. It encourages rapid iteration and adaptation, ensuring that decisions are based on the most current information and can be adjusted as new data becomes available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Six Thinking Hats**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Developed by Edward de Bono, this framework involves looking at a decision from six different perspectives (hats): White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (caution), Yellow (optimism), Green (creativity), and Blue (process).\n",
      "   - **Support**: By encouraging decision-makers to consider multiple viewpoints systematically, this framework helps in uncovering blind spots, balancing emotional and logical aspects, and fostering creative solutions. It ensures a holistic analysis and reduces the risk of biased or one-dimensional thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these frameworks provides a structured approach to decision-making, helping to improve the quality of analysis, reasoning, and ultimately, the decisions made."

      "\n",
      "1. **Pros and Cons List**:\n",
      "   - **How it works**: Write down the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of each option.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This is useful for straightforward decisions where you can clearly see the benefits and drawbacks of each choice.\n",
      "   - **Example**: Deciding whether to take a new job offer. List the pros (higher salary, better location) and cons (longer commute, less job security).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision Matrix (Weighted Scoring Model)**:\n",
      "   - **How it works**: List your options and the criteria important for the decision. Assign weights to each criterion based on importance, score each option against each criterion, and calculate the weighted scores.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Ideal for decisions with multiple factors to consider.\n",
      "   - **Example**: Choosing a new laptop. Criteria might include price, battery life, performance, and brand reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SWOT Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **How it works**: Identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to each option.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Useful for more complex decisions where internal and external factors play a role.\n",
      "   - **Example**: Deciding whether to start a new business. Analyze the strengths (unique skills), weaknesses (limited capital), opportunities (market demand), and threats (competition).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix)**:\n",
      "   - **How it works**: Categorize tasks or decisions based on their urgency and importance into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Great for prioritizing tasks and managing time effectively.\n",
      "   - **Example**: Planning your daily schedule. Tasks like a project deadline (urgent and important) versus reading a book (important but not urgent).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The 5 Whys**:\n",
      "   - **How it works**: Ask \"Why?\" five times (or as many times as needed) to drill down to the root cause of a problem or decision.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Effective for problem-solving and understanding the underlying reasons for a decision.\n",
      "   - **Example**: Figuring out why you are consistently late to work. Keep asking \"Why?\" until you identify the root cause, such as poor time management or an unreliable alarm clock.\n",
