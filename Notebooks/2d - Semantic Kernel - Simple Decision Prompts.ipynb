    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",

    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

       "   - **How It Enhances Analysis**: By assigning weights to criteria and evaluating each option objectively, the Pugh Matrix helps eliminate bias and ensures decisions are based on measurable factors. It’s especially useful when trade-offs are involved, such as choosing between competing business strategies or product designs.\n",

       "   - **How It Enhances Analysis**: This framework helps decision-makers identify the nature of a given situation, ensuring the use of context-appropriate strategies. For instance, structured processes might work in simple situations, while experimentation and adaptability are necessary in complex or chaotic scenarios.\n",

       "   - **How It Supports Analysis**: SWOT promotes a balanced view by encouraging consideration of both positive and negative aspects of a decision or strategy. It helps identify competitive advantages, areas for improvement, future opportunities, and potential risks, offering a comprehensive overview of a scenario.\n",

       "---\n",

       "   - **Description**: CBA involves comparing the costs and benefits of a decision to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\n",
       "   - **How It Supports Analysis**: By quantifying costs and benefits (monetary or qualitative), CBA ensures decisions are rooted in data and logic rather than intuition alone. It simplifies complex decisions by focusing on overall net value, enabling better resource allocation and prioritization.\n",

       "   - **How It Supports Analysis**: The matrix helps decision-makers focus on what matters most (important but not urgent) while minimizing distractions from less critical tasks. It enhances time management and productivity, especially for prioritizing actions in busy or dynamic environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",

       "   - **Description**: A decision tree is a visual tool that maps possible choices, outcomes, probabilities, and payoffs in a decision-making process.\n",
       "   - **How It Supports Analysis**: By breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, decision trees provide clarity on each option and its associated risks. They also help evaluate outcomes under uncertainty and support evidence-based reasoning through a logical structure.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",

       "   - **How It Supports Analysis**: The method encourages a holistic approach by considering logical, emotional, and creative factors systematically.
