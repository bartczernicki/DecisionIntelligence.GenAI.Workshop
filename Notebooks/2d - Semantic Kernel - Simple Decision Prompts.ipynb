    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

    "* Add structure to the output with formatting\n",
    "* Provide examples with few-shot prompting\n",
    "* Instruct the AI what to do to avoid doing something else\n",

    "A key best practice is to provide a common behavior across all the LLM interactions in a system prompt. This system prompt is passed in on every single call the LLM with Semantic Kernel. By passing the same (or similar) system prompt with every prompt gives your Generative AI system a common persona. This common persona is the foundational building block of building AI agents; where the desired behavior is to have each agent have a unique persona/behavior every time you interact with that agent.\n",
