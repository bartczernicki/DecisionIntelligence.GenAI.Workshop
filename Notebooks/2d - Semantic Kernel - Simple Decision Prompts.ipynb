    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

      "   - **Suitable for:** Problem-solving, quality management, process improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
      "   - **How it helps:** Derived from military strategy, this cycle emphasizes rapid and continuous reassessment and adaptation. It supports agile and responsive decision-making by encouraging the constant adjustment to changing situations.\n",

      "Certainly! Here are several decision-making frameworks that can enhance the quality of decisions, along with brief descriptions of how each supports better analysis and reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This framework helps in identifying internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It provides a structured way to evaluate the internal and external factors that can impact a decision, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PEST Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This framework examines the macro-environmental factors that could influence a decision.\n",
      "   - **Support**: By analyzing these four key areas, decision-makers can anticipate potential impacts from the external environment and make more informed strategic choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decision Matrix (Weighted Scoring Model)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This tool involves listing options and criteria, assigning weights to each criterion, and scoring each option against the criteria.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It helps in quantitatively comparing different options based on multiple criteria, making it easier to identify the best choice objectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This method involves comparing the costs and benefits of different options.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It provides a clear financial perspective, helping to determine whether the benefits of a decision outweigh the costs, which is crucial for resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Six Thinking Hats**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Developed by Edward de Bono, this framework involves looking at a decision from six different perspectives (logical, emotional, cautious, optimistic, creative, and process-oriented).\n",
      "   - **Support**: It encourages comprehensive thinking and helps in exploring all aspects of a decision, reducing the risk of bias and blind spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This principle suggests that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It helps in identifying the most significant factors that will have the greatest impact, allowing decision-makers to focus on the most critical issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This technique involves identifying the underlying causes of a problem rather than just addressing the symptoms.\n",
      "   - **Support**: By understanding the root causes, decision-makers can develop more effective and sustainable solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Scenario Planning**\n",
      "   - **Description**: This involves creating detailed and plausible scenarios for the future and analyzing how different decisions would play out in each scenario.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It prepares decision-makers for a range of possible futures, enhancing flexibility and strategic planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Developed by military strategist John Boyd, this loop emphasizes a continuous cycle of observing, orienting, deciding, and acting.\n",
      "   - **Support**: It promotes agility and rapid decision-making, which is particularly useful in dynamic and fast-changing environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Pros and Cons List**\n",
      "    - **Description**: A simple technique where the positive and negative aspects of each option are listed.\n",
      "    - **Support**: It provides a clear visual comparison of the advantages and disadvantages, aiding in straightforward decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix)**\n",
      "    - **Description**: This matrix helps prioritize tasks by categorizing them based on their urgency and importance.\n",
      "    - **Support**: It aids in time management and ensures that attention is focused on the most critical tasks, improving productivity and decision quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Monte Carlo Simulation**\n",
      "    - **Description**: This statistical technique uses random sampling and statistical modeling to estimate the probabilities of different outcomes.\n",
      "    - **Support**: It provides a probabilistic analysis of risk and uncertainty, which is valuable for complex decisions involving multiple variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these frameworks offers unique strengths and can be chosen based on the specific context and requirements of the decision-making scenario. By applying these frameworks, decision-makers can enhance their analysis, reasoning, and ultimately the quality of their decisions."
