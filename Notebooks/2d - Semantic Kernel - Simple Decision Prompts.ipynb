    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "
