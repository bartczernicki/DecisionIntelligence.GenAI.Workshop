    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

       "### 1. **The Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important Matrix)**\n",
       "   - **Best for**: Managing time and prioritizing tasks or decisions.\n",
       "   - **How it works**:\n",
       "     - Draw a 2x2 grid with \"Urgent\" vs. \"Not Urgent\" on one axis and \"Important\" vs. \"Not Important\" on the other.\n",
       "     - Categorize tasks or decisions into one of the four quadrants:\n",
       "       1. **Urgent & Important (Do now)** – Handle immediately.\n",
       "       2. **Not Urgent & Important (Schedule)** – Plan for later.\n",
       "       3. **Urgent & Not Important (Delegate)** – Delegate or minimize effort.\n",
       "       4. **Not Urgent & Not Important (Eliminate)** – Ignore or delete.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
       "   - **Best for**: Quick decision-making in dynamic or uncertain situations.\n",
       "   - **How it works**:\n",
       "     - **Observe**: Gather relevant information about the situation.\n",
       "     - **Orient**: Analyze the data and understand your options.\n",
       "     - **Decide**: Choose the best course of action based on your goals.\n",
       "     - **Act**: Execute your decision, then loop back to observe the outcome.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",

       "   - **Best for**: Evaluating the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of a decision.\n",
       "   - **How it works**:\n",
       "     - Ask yourself:\n",
       "       1. How will I feel about this decision in **10 minutes**?\n",
       "       2. How will I feel about it in **10 months**?\n",

       "     - Use these perspectives to assess whether the decision aligns with your long-term values and goals.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**\n",
       "   - **Best for**: Identifying high-impact decisions or actions.\n",
       "   - **How it works**:\n",
       "     - Recognize that **80% of results often come from 20% of causes**.\n",
       "     - Focus your energy and decision-making on the small percentage of actions (key 20%) that yield the most significant results (vital 80%).\n",

       "\n",
       "### 5. **The \"WOOP\" Method (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan)**\n",
       "   - **Best for**: Turning decisions into actionable plans.\n",
       "   - **How it works**:\n",
       "     1. **Wish**: Define your objective or desired result (what do you want?).\n",
       "     2. **Outcome**: Visualize the best result if your wish is fulfilled.\n",
       "     3. **Obstacle**: Identify what could stand in your way (internal or external).\n",
       "     4. **Plan**: Create a \"if-then\" strategy to overcome obstacles and achieve your goal.\n",
       "     - Example: \"If I get distracted, then I'll set a 10-minute timer to refocus.\"\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Bonus: **The Two-Minute Rule**\n",
       "   - **Best for**: Deciding whether to act on small tasks or defer them.\n",
       "   - **How it works**: If an action will take **less than two minutes**, do it immediately rather than overthinking or procrastinating.\n",
       "   - **Why it works**: Eliminates clutter and helps you stay on top of small but important daily decisions.\n",
