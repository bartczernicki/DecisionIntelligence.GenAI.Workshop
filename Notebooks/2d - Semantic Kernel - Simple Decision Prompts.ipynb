If you’ve used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’re already familiar with prompting: given an instruction, a language model predicts the most likely and relevant response. With Semantic Kernel, you can build applications, services, and APIs that execute these prompts.  \n",

Useful for investments, project selection, medical decisions, and any sequential decisions under uncertainty.\n",

              "How it helps: Makes tradeoffs explicit (weights and scores), reduces implicit bias by forcing numeric comparisons, and supports sensitivity analysis to see how changes in priorities affect the outcome. Good for vendor selection, policy choices, hiring/prioritization, and any complex decision where multiple objectives matter.\n",

              "How it helps: Encourages quantifying uncertainty and updating estimates as information arrives, which improves calibration and prevents stubborn adherence to prior assumptions; it also supports formal tradeoffs between risks and rewards. Especially helpful in diagnostics, forecasting, A/B testing, and adaptive planning where data accumulates over time.\n",

Best for time‑sensitive operations, crisis management, competitive strategy, or real‑time control systems.\n",
