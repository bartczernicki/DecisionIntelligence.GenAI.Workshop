    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

      "   - **How It Supports Decision-Making:** SWOT provides a structured way to assess risks and benefits, anticipate challenges, and leverage advantages. It's particularly useful in strategic planning and business decisions that require understanding external and internal dynamics.\n",

      "   - **Description:** A visual tool that represents decisions and their potential consequences in a tree-like structure, mapping out different paths and outcomes based on alternative choices.\n",

      "### Key Reasoning:\n",
      "1. **Financial Prudence**: Starting at a community college saves significant money, which is particularly important given Alex's uncertainty about her major. This approach reduces the financial burden and allows her to explore her interests without the pressure of high tuition costs.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Flexibility for Exploration**: Community college provides a lower-stakes environment for Alex to explore her interests in business, psychology, and the arts. Once she has more clarity, she can transfer to a four-year university with a focused plan, minimizing the risk of extended time in school.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Long-Term Financial Stability**: By saving money in the first two years, Alex can reduce the amount of student loan debt she incurs, giving her more financial freedom after graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transfer Opportunities**: Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year universities, ensuring that credits transfer seamlessly. This allows Alex to transition smoothly to a bachelor's program without losing time or academic progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Networking and Professional Growth**: While Alex may delay access to university-level networking opportunities, she can still build strong connections after transferring. The delayed start to networking is outweighed by the financial and exploratory benefits of starting at a community college.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Starting at a community college allows Alex to explore her academic interests at a lower cost, reduces financial risk, and provides a solid foundation for transferring to a four-year university. This path aligns with her goals of minimizing debt while gaining clarity about her career direction."
