    "You have probably heard of a **postmortem (post-mortem)**, which is a look back at an actual failure (or success) to understand why it happened and learn from it. In the context of decision making, after the decision outcome is clear you can analyze why the result occured. For example, a hedge fund may host a postmortem meeting after analyzing an unsuccesful move on a tech stock that didn't materialize the return on investment as was planned. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **premortem (pre-mortem)** the outcome is \"imagined\" and then it is figured out why that potential \"imagined\" outcome happened. In a premortem, a planning exercise is held where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential risks and address them before starting the project. Therefore, it’s a bit like predicting the future and using that prediction to make the forecast stronger. "
