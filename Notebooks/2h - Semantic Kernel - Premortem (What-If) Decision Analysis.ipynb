    "You have probably heard of a **postmortem (post-mortem)**, which is a look back at an actual failure (or success) to understand why it happened and learn from it. In the context of decision making, after the decision outcome is clear you can analyze why the result occured. For example, a hedge fund may host a postmortem meeting after analyzing an unsuccesful move on a tech stock that didn't materialize the return on investment as was planned. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **premortem (pre-mortem)** the outcome is \"imagined\" and then it is figured out why that potential \"imagined\" outcome happened. In a premortem, a planning exercise is held where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential risks and address them before starting the project. Therefore, it’s a bit like predicting the future and using that prediction to make the forecast stronger. "

      "\n",
      "#### **Failure Scenarios for Purchasing a Car**\n",
      "1. **Financial Strain**: The upfront cost or monthly loan payments exceeded your budget, leading to financial stress or inability to cover other expenses.\n",
      "2. **Depreciation Loss**: The car’s value depreciated faster than expected, leaving you with a low resale value if you decide to sell it.\n",
      "3. **Maintenance Costs**: Unexpected repair and maintenance costs accumulated over time, making ownership more expensive than anticipated.\n",
      "4. **Lifestyle Changes**: Your circumstances changed (e.g., relocation, new job, family growth), and the car no longer fits your needs.\n",
      "5. **Technology Obsolescence**: The car’s features became outdated quickly, especially with advancements in electric vehicles (EVs) or autonomous driving technology.\n",
      "6. **Missed Opportunities**: You tied up capital in the purchase, limiting your ability to invest in other opportunities (e.g., savings, investments, or experiences).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Failure Scenarios for Leasing a Car**\n",
      "1. **Exceeding Mileage Limits**: You exceeded the mileage limits specified in the lease agreement, resulting in costly penalties.\n",
      "2. **Wear-and-Tear Fees**: The car incurred excessive wear and tear, leading to additional charges at the end of the lease.\n",
      "3. **Lack of Ownership**: At the end of the lease, you have no equity in the car, and you must start over with another lease or purchase.\n",
      "4. **Long-Term Costs**: Leasing turned out to be more expensive over time compared to purchasing, especially if you leased multiple cars consecutively.\n",
      "5. **Lifestyle Incompatibility**: The lease terms (e.g., mileage limits, contract length) didn’t align with your lifestyle or driving habits.\n",
      "6. **Early Termination Fees**: You needed to end the lease early due to unforeseen circumstances, incurring significant penalties.\n",

      "#### **Root Causes for Purchasing Failure**\n",
      "- **Budget Miscalculation**: Underestimating total costs (e.g., loan interest, insurance, taxes, maintenance).\n",

      "- **Maintenance Neglect**: Lack of research on reliability and repair costs for the car.\n",

      "- **Cost Comparison Oversight**: Inadequate analysis of long-term costs versus purchasing.\n",

      "3. **Reliability Assessment**: Research the car’s reliability ratings and estimated maintenance costs.\n",

    "Exploring space with telescopes is a time consuming investment. Current telescope designs are limited to exploring small areas of space in a certain time frame. Without going into details, the process is much more complex than snapping a picture with a mobile device. Telescopes can be pointed at a specific space area for days, weeks or even more than months! If a telescope is exploring a certain area of space it isn't collecting data on other areas. Scientists and researchers compete for valuable access to telescope resources by providing observatories what space area they want to explore, any cellestial contraints, timeframes, calibration costs, data collection transfer etc. This presents a very interesting Decision Intelligence constraints problem that observatories must manage. \n",

    "A newly commissioned radio telescope stands on the verge of unveiling the proof of alien life, but it is still far from fully calibrated. Despite limited data processing capacity and a software suite that remains untested, an unexpected cosmic event has just begun, hinting at signals that could reveal alien life. Faced with the risk of hardware damage or data corruption from running the telescope prematurely, scientists debate whether to switch it on now or wait until everything is fully operational—knowing they could lose a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Determined not to squander this brief cosmic window, the team conducts a premortem analysis to predict what might go wrong. Armed with these insights, they can better prepare for potential pitfalls and strengthen their chances of catching historic signals from across the galaxy.\n",

Furthermore, assume a that this decision has led to a disaster with hardware failure to the telescope. Even though the (What-If) decision was made to rush the radio telescope operationally, formal scientific telescope operations have been followed. The goal of this premortem (What-If analysis) is to illuminate any risk mitigation strategies and craft a risk mitigation approach that may have been uncovered based on the premortem. \n",

      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Compromised or Unusable Data**\n",
      "   - **Signal Interference:** The telescope's uncalibrated state led to misaligned antennas, causing signal distortion or overlap.\n",
      "   - **Data Corruption:** The untested software suite failed to handle the high data throughput, resulting in corrupted files or incomplete datasets.\n",
      "   - **Noise Misclassification:** Without proper calibration, the system misclassified cosmic noise or Earth-origin interference as potential signals, rendering the data unreliable.\n",
      "   - **Insufficient Storage Management:** The team underestimated the storage requirements, leading to overwriting or loss of critical data.\n",
      "   - **Inadequate Signal Filtering:** Algorithms designed to isolate alien signals were either incomplete or malfunctioning, leading to false positives or missed detections.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Errors from Incomplete Software Testing and Rushed Calibration**\n",
      "   - **Software Bugs:** Unvetted code caused crashes, data loss, or misinterpretation of signals.\n",
      "   - **Algorithmic Errors:** Signal-processing algorithms were not optimized, leading to incorrect conclusions or wasted computational resources.\n",
      "   - **Calibration Drift:** The rushed calibration process introduced systematic errors, such as incorrect frequency tuning or beam misalignment.\n",
      "   - **Incompatibility Issues:** Integration between hardware and software was incomplete, causing synchronization failures or delays in data processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Overlooked Safety Protocols and Hardware Precautions**\n",

      "### Preventive Measures and Fail-Safes for Early Activation\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Technical Safeguards**\n",
      "1. **Stress Testing:** Conduct a rapid but thorough stress test of the hardware and software to identify weak points before activation.\n",
      "2. **Incremental Activation:** Gradually ramp up the telescope's capacity to avoid overloading systems.\n",
      "3. **Backup Systems:** Implement redundant data storage and processing systems to prevent data loss or corruption.\n",
      "4. **Signal Validation:** Use a secondary, independent system to cross-check signals for accuracy and reduce false positives.\n",
      "5. **Environmental Monitoring:** Install sensors to monitor temperature, power fluctuations, and other environmental factors in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Software and Calibration Improvements**\n",
      "6. **Critical Path Testing:** Focus on testing the most essential software functions (e.g., data capture, storage, and signal filtering) before activation.\n",
      "7. **Calibration Simulations:** Use historical data or simulations to refine calibration settings without requiring full telescope operation.\n",
      "8. **Error Logging:** Ensure the software logs all errors in real-time for rapid troubleshooting.\n",
      "9. **Algorithm Prioritization:** Deploy only the most reliable signal-processing algorithms, deferring experimental features for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Operational and Procedural Changes**\n",
      "10. **Decision Framework:** Establish a clear decision-making protocol that balances risks and rewards, with input from all stakeholders.\n",
      "11. **Pre-Event Drills:** Conduct a \"dry run\" of the telescope's activation process to identify potential bottlenecks.\n",
      "12. **Emergency Shutdown Protocol:** Develop a fail-safe mechanism to power down the telescope safely in case of hardware strain or software failure.\n",
      "13. **Data Triage:** Prioritize capturing raw data over real-time processing to ensure nothing is lost, even if analysis must occur later.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Team and Communication Enhancements**\n",
      "14. **Role Clarity:** Assign clear responsibilities to each team member to avoid duplication or oversight.\n",
      "15. **Real-Time Communication:** Use a centralized communication platform to ensure all team members are updated on"
