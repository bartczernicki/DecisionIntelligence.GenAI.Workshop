    "You have probably heard of a **postmortem (post-mortem)**, which is a look back at an actual failure (or success) to understand why it happened and learn from it. In the context of decision making, after the decision outcome is clear you can analyze why the result occured. For example, a hedge fund may host a postmortem meeting after analyzing an unsuccesful move on a tech stock that didn't materialize the return on investment as was planned. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **premortem (pre-mortem)** the outcome is \"imagined\" and then it is figured out why that potential \"imagined\" outcome happened. In a premortem, a planning exercise is held where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential risks and address them before starting the project. Therefore, it’s a bit like predicting the future and using that prediction to make the forecast stronger. "

    "Exploring space with telescopes is a time consuming investment. Current telescope designs are limited to exploring small areas of space in a certain time frame. Without going into details, the process is much more complex than snapping a picture with a mobile device. Telescopes can be pointed at a specific space area for days, weeks or even more than months! If a telescope is exploring a certain area of space it isn't collecting data on other areas. Scientists and researchers compete for valuable access to telescope resources by providing observatories what space area they want to explore, any cellestial contraints, timeframes, calibration costs, data collection transfer etc. This presents a very interesting Decision Intelligence constraints problem that observatories must manage. \n",

    "**Intro to Decision Scenario:** A newly commissioned radio telescope stands on the verge of unveiling the proof of alien life, but it is still far from fully calibrated. Despite limited data processing capacity and a software suite that remains untested, an unexpected cosmic event has just begun, hinting at signals that could reveal alien life. Faced with the risk of hardware damage or data corruption from running the telescope prematurely, scientists debate whether to switch it on now or wait until everything is fully operational—knowing they could lose a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Determined not to squander this brief cosmic window, the team conducts a premortem analysis to predict what might go wrong. Armed with these insights, they can better prepare for potential pitfalls and strengthen their chances of catching historic signals from across the galaxy.\n",

    "**Pre-Mortem Risk Scenario:** Let's assume (pretend) the scientists decide to rush the radio telescope to operate early to find alien life. Furthermore, assume a that this decision has led to a disaster with hardware failure to the telescope. Even though the (What-If) decision was made to rush the radio telescope operationally, formal scientific telescope operations have been followed. The goal of this premortem (What-If analysis) is to illuminate any risk mitigation strategies and craft a risk mitigation approach that may have been uncovered based on the premortem. \n",
