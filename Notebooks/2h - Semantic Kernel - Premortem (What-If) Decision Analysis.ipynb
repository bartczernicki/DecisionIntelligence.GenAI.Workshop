    "You have probably heard of a **postmortem (post-mortem)**, which is a look back at an actual failure (or success) to understand why it happened and learn from it. In the context of decision making, after the decision outcome is clear you can analyze why the result occured. For example, a hedge fund may host a postmortem meeting after analyzing an unsuccesful move on a tech stock that didn't materialize the return on investment as was planned. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **premortem (pre-mortem)** the outcome is \"imagined\" and then it is figured out why that potential \"imagined\" outcome happened. In a premortem, a planning exercise is held where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential risks and address them before starting the project. Therefore, it’s a bit like predicting the future and using that prediction to make the forecast stronger. "

    "Exploring space with telescopes is a time consuming investment. Current telescope designs are limited to exploring small areas of space in a certain time frame. Without going into details, the process is much more complex than snapping a picture with a mobile device. Telescopes can be pointed at a specific space area for days, weeks or even more than months! If a telescope is exploring a certain area of space it isn't collecting data on other areas. Scientists and researchers compete for valuable access to telescope resources by providing observatories what space area they want to explore, any cellestial contraints, timeframes, calibration costs, data collection transfer etc. This presents a very interesting Decision Intelligence constraints problem that observatories must manage. \n",

    "A newly commissioned radio telescope stands on the verge of unveiling the proof of alien life, but it is still far from fully calibrated. Despite limited data processing capacity and a software suite that remains untested, an unexpected cosmic event has just begun, hinting at signals that could reveal alien life. Faced with the risk of hardware damage or data corruption from running the telescope prematurely, scientists debate whether to switch it on now or wait until everything is fully operational—knowing they could lose a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Determined not to squander this brief cosmic window, the team conducts a premortem analysis to predict what might go wrong. Armed with these insights, they can better prepare for potential pitfalls and strengthen their chances of catching historic signals from across the galaxy.\n",

Furthermore, assume a that this decision has led to a disaster with hardware failure to the telescope. Even though the (What-If) decision was made to rush the radio telescope operationally, formal scientific telescope operations have been followed. The goal of this premortem (What-If analysis) is to illuminate any risk mitigation strategies and craft a risk mitigation approach that may have been uncovered based on the premortem. \n",

      "\n",
      "In reflecting upon the failed attempt to detect potential alien signals from the sudden cosmic event, several specific issues, oversights, and cascading errors contributed to this grim scenario:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compromised or Unusable Data from Early Deployment**\n",
      "   - **Hardware Overload**: Activating the telescope prematurely without fully tested capacity led to hardware components being subjected to loads beyond their design limits, resulting in failures.\n",
      "   - **Calibration Errors**: Incomplete calibration caused misalignment of the telescope's sensors, capturing inaccurate or irrelevant data.\n",
      "   - **Signal Interference**: Without proper shielding and tuning, background noise and interference contaminated the signals, rendering data unusable.\n",
      "   - **Data Loss**: Inadequate data handling protocols led to corruption or loss during transmission and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Impact of Incomplete Software Testing and Rushed Calibration**\n",
      "   - **Software Bugs**: Unidentified bugs in the untested software caused errors in data collection, processing, and storage.\n",
      "   - **Algorithmic Errors**: Faulty signal processing algorithms misinterpreted noise as potential signals or missed actual signals.\n",
      "   - **Data Processing Bottlenecks**: Inefficient code led to delays and backlogs in data analysis, causing critical information to be overlooked.\n",
      "   - **Integration Failures**: Poor integration between software modules resulted in system crashes and inconsistent data outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Overlooked Safety Protocols and Hardware Precautions**\n",
      "   - **Cooling System Failures**: Overheating due to inadequate cooling led to hardware damage.\n",
      "   - **Power Surges**: Lack of surge protection caused electrical components to short circuit under fluctuating loads.\n",
      "   - **Mechanical Stress**: Rapid deployment without mechanical stress testing led to structural failures in moving parts.\n",
      "   - **Absence of Redundancies**: Critical systems lacked backup, so failures could not be mitigated.\n",

      "   - **Unclear Responsibilities**: Team members were unsure of their roles, leading to duplication of efforts or neglected tasks.\n",
      "   - **Ineffective Communication**: Crucial information about system limitations and errors was not promptly shared among team members.\n",
      "   - **Hasty Decision-Making**: Decisions were made without comprehensive risk assessments due to time pressure.\n",
      "   - **Missed Deadlines and Signals**: Overlooked critical deadlines for system checks, and potential signals were missed due to mismanaged priorities.\n",
      "\n",
