    "You have probably heard of a **postmortem (post-mortem)**, which is a look back at an actual failure (or success) to understand why it happened and learn from it. In the context of decision making, after the decision outcome is clear you can analyze why the result occured. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **premortem (pre-mortem)** the outcome is \"imagined\" and then it is figured out why that potential \"imagined\" outcome happened. In a premortem a planning exercise where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential problems and fix them before starting the project. Therefore, it’s a bit like predicting the future and using that prediction to make the project stronger.  "

    "* **Fuel efficiency matches needs:** You chose a car that meets your fuel efficiency needs, saving money on gas and fitting well with your daily driving habits.   \n",
