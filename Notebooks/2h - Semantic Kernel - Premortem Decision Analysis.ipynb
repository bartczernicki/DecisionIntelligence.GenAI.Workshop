In a premortem a planning exercise where a team imagines that a project or decision has already succeeded or failed. The team then works backward, brainstorming what might have caused things to go wrong. This approach allows everyone to spot potential problems and fix them before starting the project.

      "**Imagined Failure Outcome:**\n",
      "\n",
      "After purchasing the new car, you find yourself facing significant financial strain, and the vehicle does not meet your long-term needs. When trying to sell, the resale value is much lower than anticipated due to rapid depreciation and market changes.\n",

      "**Potential Causes of Failure:**\n",

      "1. **Overestimated Financial Capacity:**\n",
      "   - *Cause:* Underestimating the total cost of ownership, including loan interest, insurance, taxes, maintenance, and unexpected repairs.\n",

      "\n",

      "   - *Cause:* The car model depreciated faster than average, possibly due to market saturation, negative reviews, or release of a new model.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Lifestyle and Needs Changes:**\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Technological Obsolescence:**\n",
      "   - *Cause:* Advancements in automotive technology (e.g., electric vehicles, autonomous features) make the purchased car outdated.\n",
      "   - *Consequence:* Reduced desirability and resale value, along with missing out on newer, more efficient technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Unexpected Maintenance and Repair Costs:**\n",
      "   - *Cause:* Mechanical issues arising after warranty expiration or not covered by warranty.\n",
