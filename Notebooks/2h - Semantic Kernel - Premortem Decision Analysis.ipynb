      "**Scenario Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "You're at a crossroads: should you purchase a new car or lease one? To ensure you make the best decision, you conduct a premortem analysis imagining that, a few years down the line, you deeply regret your choice. By exploring the reasons behind this hypothetical failure, you can identify strategies to prevent them.\n",

      "### **Option 1: Purchasing a New Car**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Imagined Failure Scenario**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Two years after purchasing a new car, you find yourself in a difficult financial situation. The car's value has depreciated significantly, you're facing unexpected maintenance costs, and your circumstances have changed, making the car unsuitable for your needs. Selling the car is challenging due to negative equity, and you're burdened by high monthly payments for a vehicle that no longer serves you.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Reasons for Failure**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rapid Depreciation and Negative Equity**\n",
      "   - New cars depreciate quickly, especially in the first few years.\n",
      "   - You might owe more on the loan than the car's market value, making it difficult to sell or trade in without incurring a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Underestimating Total Ownership Costs**\n",
      "   - High monthly payments strain your budget.\n",
      "   - Insurance premiums, taxes, registration fees, and maintenance costs add up.\n",
      "   - Unanticipated repairs occur after the warranty expires.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Change in Personal Circumstances**\n",
      "   - Loss of income due to job loss or decreased earnings.\n",
      "   - Family expansion requires a larger vehicle.\n",
      "   - Relocation to an area where a car is unnecessary or parking is expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lifestyle and Usage Changes**\n",
      "   - Increased commuting distances lead to higher fuel costs.\n",
      "   - Reduced need for a car due to remote work or lifestyle changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Interest Rate Fluctuations**\n",
      "   - Choosing a variable interest rate loan leads to higher payments over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Technological Obsolescence**\n",
      "   - New models with advanced technology make your car feel outdated.\n",
      "   - Desire for better fuel efficiency or eco-friendly options like electric vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Emotional Decision-Making**\n",
      "   - Purchased a car based on wants rather than needs.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Mitigation Strategies**\n",

      "  - Understand the depreciation rates of the car models you're considering.\n",
      "  - Choose a car with strong resale value.\n",

      "- **Financial Planning**\n",
      "  - Create a detailed budget including all costs: purchase price, interest, insurance, taxes, maintenance, fuel.\n",
