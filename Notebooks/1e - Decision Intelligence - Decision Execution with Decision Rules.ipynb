This rule essentially can be applied to any practice. If you want to master software development, cooking, basketball, playing the piano etc. this rule provides you a rough time guideline to achieve this goal. Is this rule perfect? Of course not, some people may take a little less time, some might need more than 10,000 hours and some may never achieve \"mastery\" no matter how much they practice. However, it is a great guide of the required time investment that allows you to plan your decisions accordingly to achieve this goal. \n",

    "1. You can extend this rule by setting a exploration vs exploitation coefficient. What this basically means is that you can quantify how much you woud like to explore versus exploit. Going back to the dinner restaurant scenario; you may make a decision that 75% of the time you will go with a proven dinner option, but you also want to leave some exploitation to try new things and do this 25% of the time. Adding this quantified rigor for a dinner decision is probably overkill. However, for decisions of higher importance, this optimization can be highly beneficial. For example, if you have an important task that you need to give to your team; you may select your proven team members for the task but also give others a career development opportunity to newer employees occasionally.  \n",
    "2. Additional stastical analysis can be applied to this simple rule to track your exploits and your exploration. This allows you to optimize your decisions with actual statistics and math. **For example, you may have decided to \"try something new\" of the menu 5 times and the experience was not as good as the proven items. When should you stop?** This added statistical analysis can provide a probability that exploitation might be sub-optimal and should be curtailed. This optimization of the exploration vs exploitation rule is the foundation of [**Thompson Sampling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling), which can be used to optimize many scenerios like the [**Multi-Armed Bandit Gambling Problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).

    "Measuring sales performance is a crucial aspect of running a successful business. Accurately tracking and analyzing sales data helps companies understand their strengths and weaknesses, perform forecasts, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "[**Price's Law**](https://salesmetry.com/blog/2021/01/22/prices-law-competence-is-linear-incompetence-is-exponential/) is a statistical principle that describes the distribution of productivity in organizations. It states that a small proportion of employees will produce a disproportionately large amount of output. In the context of sales performance, this law suggests that a small number of salespeople will be responsible for a significant portion of total sales. According to **Price's Law**, approximately 50% of the total output of a sales team will be generated by the square root of the total number of employees in the team. For example, if a sales team has 100 members, approximately 10 of them will generate 50% of the total sales. Conversely, if a sales team is large 10,000 about 100 salespeople will account for 50% of the sales outcomes. This means that **Price's Law** estimates overall top performance drops as the size of the sales team increases! To state this another way:  \n",
    "- In a sales team consisting of 100 sales members, 10 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 10% of the sale force are top performers.\n",
    "- In a sales team consisting of 1,000 sales members, 32 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 3.2% of the sale force are top performers.\n",
    "- In a sales team consisting of 10,000 sales members, 100 top performers will account for 50% of outcome; 1% of the sale force are top performers!\n",

    ">\n",
    "> -- <cite>Jordan Peterson (Canadian psychologist, professor, and author known for his work in clinical psychology)</cite> \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, with a larger the sales team structure, less of them (as a percentage) are contributing to the overall sales success. **Price's Law** is one of the core reasons enterprise organizations split up their sales teams into various sales areas. For example, you may have a sales team focused on various technology domains, geographical regions or even industry verticals. This allows multiple top-performing teams to emerge across various sub-sales areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another quick way to operationalize **Price's Law** for sales performance is to use it to understand that a sales organization will naturally skew sales outcomes to the top performers. This is attributed to the nature of how sales accounts are allocated, the manifestation of \"luck versus skill\" and other conventions that govern sales. Furthermore, this principle has important implications for sales performance management. By understanding **Price's Law**, sales managers can focus their efforts on identifying and supporting the top-performing salespeople, who are likely to have the greatest impact on sales results. Additionally, **Price's Law** can be used to identify areas for improvement in sales performance. For example, if a large portion of sales are generated by a small number of salespeople, the manager may focus on developing and implementing training programs to improve the performance of the rest of the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while [**Price's Law**](https://salesmetry.com/blog/2021/01/22/prices-law-competence-is-linear-incompetence-is-exponential/) can provide useful insights into sales performance, it's a statistical principle and should not be used as a rigid rule or the sole measure of sales performance. Other factors, such as market conditions, customer behavior, and product features, can also impact sales results and should be considered in sales performance evaluations.

He explores how antifragility applies to various domains, including finance, health, and personal development, advocating for embracing uncertainty and learning from it.
