      "1. **List Options**: Identify all the car models you are considering.\n",
      "2. **Determine Criteria**: Identify key factors that are important for your decision, such as:\n",
      "   - Price\n",
      "   - Fuel efficiency\n",
      "   - Maintenance cost\n",
      "   - Safety features\n",
      "   - Brand reputation\n",
      "   - Resale value\n",
      "   - Comfort and interior features\n",
      "3. **Score Options**: Rate each car based on how well it meets each criterion, typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 10).\n",
      "4. **Weight Criteria**: Assign weights to each criterion based on how relevant or important each factor is to you (e.g., safety might be more important than minor interior features).\n",
      "5. **Calculate Totals**: Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them up for each car option.\n",
      "\n",
      "This framework offers the following advantages for a car purchase:\n",
      "- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: It allows you to systematically compare different car models based on multiple important factors.\n",
      "- **Quantitative Assessment**: Assigning scores and weights helps in making a more objective decision rather than relying solely on gut feeling.\n",
      "- **Customization**: You can tailor the criteria and weights to match your specific needs and preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using a Decision Matrix, you can more effectively prioritize and make a well-rounded, informed decision on which car to purchase, balancing all important aspects according to your personal priorities."

      "#### Overview:\n",
      "- **Developed By**: Colonel John Boyd, a United States Air Force military strategist.\n",
      "- **Purpose**: To make rapid and effective decisions in combat and other dynamic environments by iterating through a cycle of Observing, Orienting, Deciding, and Acting.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Steps:\n",
      "1. **Observe**: Gather current data and information about the environment, including enemy actions, terrain, and other critical factors.\n",
      "2. **Orient**: Analyze the gathered data to generate situational awareness, taking into account the strategic context, cultural influences, and experience.\n",
      "3. **Decide**: Based on the analysis, select the best course of action from the available options.\n",
