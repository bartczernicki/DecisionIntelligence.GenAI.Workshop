    "The above quote from Jeff Bezos above underscores the balance between data-driven decision-making and the role of intuition and instinct in navigating complex or uncertain situations. Intuition is usually how many people start making decisions. \n",

    "**What is intuition? Intuition is best described as the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning.** It's based on patterns and experiences that the brain has internalized over time. Intuitive judgments can be rapid and efficient, drawing on a wealth of experience & knowledge. Therefore, intuition can be a highly effective decision-making tool by people who are highly experienced. For example, a basketaball coach for 20 years has probably experienced similar patterns in basketball game scenarios allowing the coach to make immediate decisions for his team impacting a game in real-time. Therefore, intuition is a highly effective ability when decision-making needs to be as quick as possible and you have the eperience to recognize patterns very quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When is intuition NOT a great tool? \n",
    "* When one is presented with a great deal of supporting data\n",
    "* There is time to improve the quality of the decision\n",
    "* When the situation is \"new\" and past experience can't be relied on\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases listed above intuition can be unreliable. Therefore, there are much better decision intelligence options than intuition if you have the time, the data or can't draw on experience.   "

    "What does intuition have todo with Generative AI? Currently, we don't consider Generative AI LLMs as satient beings. It turns out intuition decision-making techniques can be applied to Generative AI. In the context of Generative AI, intuition is basically allowing the Generative AI model make a decision from it's own knowledge & patterns it has learned from the mountains of training data. In the same way that intuition is a rapid reasoning framework to make the decisions for humans, it is the same for Generative AI. This means that when you ask a logic question, reasoning, recommendation or for Generative AI to make a potential decision it will respond much faster following the straighforward path from it's learned patterns. You may trust a GenAI's \"intuition\" rapid response system to recommend simple scenarios, but not for making high-stakes decisions without specific instructions, knowledge or other guardrails. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an interesting connection in how humans learn from childhood to adulthood and how GenAI models are trained with data to develop their \"intuition\". Each human has their own personal life examples they are presented during their formative period or adult career. These life examples vary in the specificity of the type of examples (data), quality of examples (professional teaching or self-taught), the amount of examples and how we as hunmans internalize them. The same applies for Generative AI! When Generative AI models are trained, they are presented with varying quality and quantity data sets. They are instructed to \"learn\" from the presented data using varying algorthmic and mathematic approaches. Finally, they are trained using varying durations of time. The outcome from this training is a model that recognizes patterns and communicates them back to the user. What is more interesting as you vary the data, type of training, duration or training or size of the model's memory you get vastly different GenAI behavior. Just like people vary in their epxertise, we have trained AI models good at one specific thing (chess), are good all-around experts (Ken Jennings - Jeopardy) or good at a few things (coding, math) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you send a basic prompt to a GenAI model you are entrusting the GenAI's intuition (it's knowledge, pattern recognition and experience it has learned). The more basic the prompt and less specific the decision instructions, the more you are entrusting GenAI's intuition and learned pattern discovery. Therefore, in order to get the most decison-making capability from GenAI LLMs, one needs to apply more decision-making tools. "
