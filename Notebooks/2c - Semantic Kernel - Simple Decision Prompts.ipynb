    "Prompts are the fundemental building block to getting the proper responses from AI models. This module demonstrates how to use common prompt engineering techniques while using Semantic Kernel. If you've ever used ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you're already familiar with prompting. Given a prompt instruction, an LLM will attempt to predict the most likely response. With Semantic Kernel, you can craft applications, services & APIs that execute prompts.  \n",

    "For more information on using prompts with Semantic Kernel, visit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/prompts/your-first-prompt  \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of carefully crafting questions or instructions for AI is called **Prompt Engineering**. Prompt Engineering involves designing and refining input prompts—text or questions—so that the AI produces responses that are more relevant, useful, or accurate. The goal of prompt engineering is to \"tune\" the prompt in a way that maximizes the quality and clarity of the AI's response, often using specific wording, context, or examples within the prompt itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence and Prompt Engineering techniques can be combined to created \"Generative AI Decision Intellignce\"! This can leverage GenAI models to reason over complex tasks, gather intelligence for decisions, recommend decisions, communicate decisions etc. "

      "\n",
      "### 1. **SWOT Analysis**\n",
      "**Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats**\n",
      "- **Strengths:** Internal attributes that are helpful to achieving the objective.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** Internal attributes that are harmful to achieving the objective.\n",
      "- **Opportunities:** External factors the organization can capitalize on or use to its advantage.\n",
      "- **Threats:** External factors that could cause trouble for the organization or project.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **PEST Analysis**\n",
      "**Political, Economic, Social, Technological**\n",
      "- **Political:** Government policies, political stability, tax policies, trade regulations.\n",
      "- **Economic:** Economic growth, exchange rates, inflation rates, interest rates.\n",
      "- **Social:** Cultural aspects, health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution.\n",
      "- **Technological:** Technological advancements, innovation, automation, R&D activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**\n",
      "- **Identify Costs:** Direct, indirect, tangible, and intangible costs.\n",
      "- **Identify Benefits:** Direct, indirect, tangible, and intangible benefits.\n",
      "- **Compare:** Weigh the total expected costs against the total expected benefits to determine the best course of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Decision Matrix (Weighted Scoring Model)**\n",
      "- **Criteria Identification:** List the criteria important for the decision.\n",
      "- **Weight Assignment:** Assign a weight to each criterion based on its importance.\n",
      "- **Scoring:** Score each option against each criterion.\n",
      "- **Calculation:** Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them to get a total score for each option.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Six Thinking Hats**\n",
      "- **White Hat:** Focus on data, facts, and information.\n",
      "- **Red Hat:** Look at the decision using intuition, gut reaction, and emotion.\n",
      "- **Black Hat:** Consider the potential negative outcomes and risks.\n",
      "- **Yellow Hat:** Focus on the positive aspects and benefits.\n",
      "- **Green Hat:** Think creatively and explore new ideas.\n",

      "- **Identify Problems:** List all problems or decisions that need to be made.\n",
      "- **Score Problems:** Assign a score based on the impact of each problem.\n",
      "- **Prioritize:** Focus on the problems that have the highest scores, as solving these will have the most significant impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **OODA Loop**\n",
      "**Observe, Orient, Decide, Act**\n",
      "- **Observe:** Gather current information from as many sources as possible.\n",
      "- **Orient:** Analyze this information to form a situational awareness.\n",
      "- **Decide:** Determine a course of action based on the information.\n",
      "- **Act:** Implement the decision and then observe the results to start the loop again.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Pros and Cons List**\n",
      "- **Pros:** List all the advantages or positive outcomes of the decision.\n",
      "- **Cons:** List all the disadvantages or negative outcomes of the decision.\n",
      "- **Compare:** Weigh the pros against the cons to make a balanced decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**\n",
      "- **Identify the Problem:** Clearly define the issue.\n",
      "- **Collect Data:** Gather information related to the problem.\n",
      "- **Identify Possible Causes:** Use tools like the 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram to find the root cause.\n",
      "- **Implement Solutions:** Develop and implement solutions to address the root cause.\n",
      "\n",
