    "One of the most effective techniques to improve logic, reasoning and overall decision-making for most LLMs is to use \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) techniques. The \"Chain of Thought\" approach helps by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, making it easier to solve problems without missing important details. It improves accuracy because each step is made clear to the LLM and helps avoid mistakes. This method also makes the thought process easier to understand and explain, allowing for easier corrections when something goes wrong. The approach is useful for handling difficult concepts and multi-step problems like math or logic, making things clearer and more manageable.\n",

Prior to Generative AI, the concepts have been known as: \"structured thinking\", \"MECE framework\" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), and \"hypothesis-driven problem-solving\".  "

      "### Step 2: Break Down the Reasoning Process\n",

      "1. Identify the constraints and ensure they are not violated at any point.\n",
      "2. Develop a step-by-step plan to transport all three items across the river safely.\n",
      "3. Verify that the solution works by checking each step against the constraints.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Third Trip:** The farmer takes the wolf across the river.  \n",
      "   - Now, the farmer cannot leave the wolf and the goat together on the far side, as the wolf would eat the goat. To prevent this, the farmer brings the goat back to the starting side on the return trip.\n",

      "4. **Fourth Trip:** The farmer takes the cabbage across the river.  \n",
      "   - On this trip, the wolf is left alone on the far side of the river, and the cabbage is now safely transported to the far side. The goat is back on the starting side.\n",

      "5. **Fifth Trip:** The farmer goes back alone to the starting side.  \n",
      "   - At this point, the wolf and cabbage are safely on the far side, and the goat is on the starting side.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Sixth Trip:** The farmer takes the goat across the river one final time.  \n",
      "   - Now, all three items (wolf, goat, and cabbage) are safely on the far side of the river.\n",
      "\n",

      "- At no point are the goat and cabbage left alone together.\n",

      "\n",

      "**Key Point:** The farmer can safely transport the goat, wolf, and cabbage across the river by following a specific sequence of trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supporting Details:**\n",
      "1. Take the goat across the river first.\n",
      "2. Return alone to the starting side.\n",
      "3. Take the wolf across the river, but bring the goat back on the return trip.\n",
      "4. Take the cabbage across the river.\n",

      "- **Approach 1:** The solution is detailed and provides a structured, step-by-step explanation of how to transport the items safely across the river. However, it does not explicitly explain the reasoning behind why each step is chosen (e.g., why the goat is taken first or why the goat is brought back after taking the wolf).\n",
      "- **Approach 2:** This approach is more detailed in its explanation. It not only provides the step-by-step solution but also explains the reasoning behind each step (e.g., why the goat is taken first as the \"middle\" item, why the goat is brought back, etc.). This makes the solution more comprehensive and easier to understand.\n",

      "#### Quality of the Reasoning Communicated:\n",
      "- **Approach 1:** The reasoning is communicated clearly and concisely. However, it lacks some depth in explaining why specific actions are taken, which might leave the reader wondering about the rationale behind certain steps.\n",
      "- **Approach 2:** The reasoning is communicated with greater clarity and depth. By breaking down the problem and explaining the reasoning behind each step, this approach ensures that the reader fully understands the solution and the logic behind it.\n",

      "Both approaches provide correct solutions to the problem, but **Approach 2** is superior due to its more detailed explanation and justification of the reasoning behind each step."

    "Imagine you’ve hurt your leg playing a game of football. You have another football season quickly approaching and you would like to understand how long will it take to heal properly. Furthermore, you would like to understand the optimal treatment to ensure you are ready at the start of the football season. You decide to visit three different doctors for their medical opinions. You don’t want to rely on just one doctor because each professional might notice something the others miss. Each specialist may decide to recommend a different approach based on their expertise or their own experience treating leg injuries. After you receive opinions from three different specialists, you think about their recommendations and then formulate a path forward (decision) for a treatment plan for your leg. The final treatment plan could be a result a variety of factors. For example, it could be simple and all three doctors could recommend 4-6 weeks rest. What if the doctors diverge in their opinions? What if 2 of 3 doctors recommend rest and a third recommends an additional procedure on top of rest? What if all three doctors opinions totally diverge? Now you have to judge those doctor opinions collectively or potentially weight one doctor's opinion more significantly. \n",

    "Sir Francis Galton, an English statistician, collected 787 guesses from fairgoers trying to estimate the weight of an ox. The average guess was 1,197 pounds, and the actual weight of the ox turned out to be 1,198 pounds. To Galton’s surprise, the average of these guesses (1,197 pounds) came remarkably close to the ox’s actual weight (1,198 pounds)—off by a single pound, or less than 0.1%. That level of accuracy was notable because the crowd was composed of a mixed audience: farmers with relevant experience, but also onlookers, tradespeople, and curious fairgoers with no particular expertise.\n",

    "Many schools and charities run fundraisers where people pay to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar. It’s commonly observed that while individual guesses can be wildly off, the average of a sufficiently large group is typically within a small percentage (often under 5% error) of the true count. As an example, Michael Mauboussin ran an 2007 experiment where Mauboussin presented a jar of jelly beans to 73 Columbia Business School students. The students' guesses ranged from 250 to 4,100, with an average error of 62%. However, the group's average guess was 1,151, which represented only a 3% off the correct number. Only two students guessed better!\n",

    "\n",
    "When the USS Scorpion, a nuclear-powered submarine, vanished in 1968, the Navy enlisted a broad range of specialists to harness their varied expertise and wisdom for a methodical search. By applying Bayesian statistical techniques to each person’s estimate of where the submarine might lie, they were able to synthesize these disparate perspectives into a single, remarkably accurate prediction. The team’s calculated guess put the submarine’s probable location just a few hundred yards from its actual resting place! This is a testament to the effectiveness of coalescing multiple expert viewpoints. This success with the USS Scorpion search later inspired more widespread use of Bayesian approaches for complex rescue and recovery operations, affirming the power of collective intelligence in high-stakes scenarios."
