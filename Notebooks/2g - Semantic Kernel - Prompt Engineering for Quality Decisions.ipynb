    "One of the most effective techniques to improve logic, reasoning and overall decision-making for most LLMs is to use \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) techniques. The \"Chain of Thought\" approach helps by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, making it easier to solve problems without missing important details. It improves accuracy because each step is made clear to the LLM and helps avoid mistakes. This method also makes the thought process easier to understand and explain, allowing for easier corrections when something goes wrong. The approach is useful for handling difficult concepts and multi-step problems like math or logic, making things clearer and more manageable.\n",

Breaking down complex tasks into simpler more approachable steps and organizing thoughts has been used by decision-makers, professional services organizations and management consulting companies for quite some time. Prior to Generative AI, the concepts have been known as: \"structured thinking\", \"MECE framework\" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), and \"hypothesis-driven problem-solving\".  "

      "#### Key Observations:\n",
      "- The goat is the \"critical\" item because it interacts with both the wolf and the cabbage. Therefore, the farmer must carefully manage the goat's position to ensure it is never left alone with the wolf or the cabbage.\n",

      "- At no point are the goat and cabbage left alone together.\n",
      "- The farmer successfully uses the boat to manage the positions of the items and ensures their safety throughout the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Final Answer\n",
      "Using the Minto Pyramid Principle:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Point**: The farmer can safely transport the goat, wolf, and cabbage across the river by following a specific sequence of trips.\n",

      "**Supporting Points**:\n",
      "1. First, the farmer takes the goat across the river.\n",
      "2. Then, the farmer returns alone and takes the wolf across, bringing the goat back to the starting side.\n",
      "3. Next, the farmer takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf.\n",

However, it does not explicitly analyze the problem before diving into the solution, which might leave some readers without a full understanding of the reasoning process.\n",
      "- **Approach 2**: This approach is more detailed in terms of problem analysis. It begins by breaking down the problem, identifying the constraints, and explaining the reasoning behind the solution. The explanation of the goat as the \"critical\" item adds depth to the analysis. The step-by-step solution is also clearly presented, and the review of the thought process at the end ensures the reader fully understands the reasoning.\n",

    "Imagine you’ve hurt your leg playing a long season of football games. You have another football season quickly approaching and you would like to understand how long will it take to heal properly. Additionally, you would like to understand the optimal medical treatment to ensure you are ready at the start of the next football season. You decide to visit three different doctors for their medical opinions. You don’t want to rely on just one doctor because each professional might notice something the others miss. Each medical specialist may decide to recommend a different approach based on their expertise or their own experience treating leg injuries. After you receive opinions from three different specialists, you think about their recommendations and then formulate a path forward (decision) for a treatment plan for your leg. The final treatment plan could be a result a variety of factors. For example, it could be simple and all three doctors could recommend 4-6 weeks rest. Clearly in that case there is a consensus with three different doctors on the treatment approach. What if the doctors diverge in their opinions? What if 2 of 3 doctors recommend rest and a third recommends an additional procedure on top of rest? What if all three doctors opinions totally diverge? Now you have to personally judge those doctor opinions collectively or potentially weight one doctor's opinion more significantly than others. This scenario illustrates a simplified version of collective intelligence, where pooling diverse expert opinions often leads to a more informed and balanced decision.\n",

    "The idea of multiple experts arriving at a cohesive conclusion isn’t new. It has been demonstated that pooling the wisdom of multiple “opinions” can often outperform a single prediction.

You have probably have heard the terms: Wisdom of the Crowds, Collective Intelligence, Bootstrapping (technique in statistical analysis), Ensembling (Machine Learing) or Mixture of Experts (Generative AI).

To Galton’s surprise, the average of these guesses (1,197 pounds) came remarkably close to the ox’s actual weight (1,198 pounds)—off by a single pound, or less than 0.1%. That level of accuracy was notable because the crowd was composed of a mixed audience: farmers with relevant experience, but also onlookers, tradespeople, and curious fairgoers with no particular expertise.\n",

As an example, Michael Mauboussin ran an 2007 experiment where Mauboussin presented a jar of jelly beans to 73 Columbia Business School students. The students' guesses ranged from 250 to 4,100, with an average error of 62%. However, the group's average guess was 1,151, which represented only a 3% off the correct number.

    "In 2006, Netflix launched the million-dollar Netflix Prize competition, challenging participants to improve its movie recommendation algorithm (Cinematch) by at least 10 percent. Over three years, data scientists and researchers worldwide experimented with innovative approaches, culminating in 2009 when an ensemble team calling itself “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” finally met the 10-percent threshold with 10.06%. This group had blended multiple models into a single “ensemble” algorithm that outperformed any single predictive approach. This demonstrated how synthesis of different predictions can be more powerful than one model alone. Although Netflix ultimately chose not to deploy the winning solution due to technical and privacy considerations, the competition is still regarded as a landmark moment in machine learning and collective problem-solving.  \n",

    "When the USS Scorpion, a nuclear-powered submarine, vanished in 1968, the Navy enlisted a broad range of specialists to harness their varied expertise and wisdom for a methodical search. By applying Bayesian statistical techniques to each person’s estimate of where the submarine might lie, they were able to synthesize these disparate perspectives into a single, remarkably accurate prediction. The team’s calculated guess put the submarine’s probable location just a few hundred yards from its actual resting place! This is a testament to the effectiveness of coalescing multiple expert viewpoints. This success with the USS Scorpion search later inspired more widespread use of Bayesian approaches for complex rescue and recovery operations, affirming the power of collective intelligence in high-stakes scenarios."

    "It is important to understand that Collective Intelligence mechanisms are rooted in several statistics principles. This allows you to set up Collective Intelligence parameters appropriately for decision situations. Furthermore, this allows you to perform math (quantitative analysis) in the Decision Intelligence Execution step. The key statistical principles of Collective Intelligence:  \n",
    "* **Average of Independent Predictions:** The average of many independent predictions, opinions or guesses will average itself out towards the true value. Each individual prediction can be assumed to have an error.  \n",
    "Therefore the formula is:  Prediction = True Value + Error.  \n",
    "As long as the errors are random, they will cancel each other out on average. \n",
    "* **Law of Large Numbers:** The more guesses you have, the more the random errors balance out, reducing the overall variance of the collective guess. Mathematically, if you have a large number of independent predictions, the average guess converges on the True Value. \n",
    "* **Central Limit Theorem:** The distribution of preductions will tend toward a bell curve (a normal distribution) around the Predicted True Value. When you take the average (mean) of a large sample from a sample distribution like this, it will often fall near the true population distribution. This happens more often in real-life than statistics courses lead on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics explaining Collective Intelligence (Wisdom of the Crowds) is greatly simplfied and there are things to consider when attempting to replicate this experiment with real-world decision situations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bias Matters:** Collective Intelligence works best when individual biases do not all tilt in the same direction. For example, if you only poll basketball players about height-related predictions, it may introduce a huge bias towards larger height in a single direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independence:** The group’s diversity and independence of guesses are critical. A group of people trained in the same way or over-influenced by each other’s guesses might show correlated errors, undermining the benefit of aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Meaningful Sample Size:** The sampling error shrinks as you collect more predictions (guesses). Assume you have 𝑁 amount of independent predictions. If each prediction's random error in guessing has a standard deviation of 𝜎, then the standard error of the mean guess drops by about a factor of $\\sqrt{𝑁}$. What does this mean? The more samples you add, the more reduction of the error you will notice. Furthermore, you will notice a larger reduction in error with the first initial predictions than further predictions made. Saying it another way. For example, if you have a certain error from 10 samples and you want to reduce that prediction error by half you need a total of 40 samples. Conversely, if you have 100 samples and you want to reduce that prediction error by half you need a total of 400 samples! "
