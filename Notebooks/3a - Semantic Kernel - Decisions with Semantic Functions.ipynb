    "Semantic Kernel Functions are the core building blocks of functionality for intelligent AI orchestration. Semantic Kernel functions usually have a single responsibility to perform. For example, a Sementic Kernel function can: send an e-mail, call an API, recommend a reasoning framework for a high-stakes decision etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Semantic Kernel functions so special? Can't one just produce similar outcomes by using a prompt in an LLM or just writing a software program? In order to answer that, one has to look at what makes GenAI so innovative. The GenAI models have a unique ability to process instructions with reasoning and logic. This allows these models to behave almost like a human decision maker. Even with basic prompts, GenAI models perform reasonably well. However, providing GenAI models with additional functions allows them to gain access to business processes, data and basically anything a GenAI model should consider when performing AI orchestration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to prepare a great Thanksgiving dinner and want to get help from a GenAI cooking application to create a new recipe. You enter what you want todo and it comes up with the most delicious looking feast for Thanksgiving. However, there is a problem it used ingredients and recommended using cooking appliances that you do not own! You could enter all of the ingredients and keep prompting until it narrowed down the what you could realistically make. Wouldn't it be better if the GenAI cooking application had access to: your available ingredients, your time availability, kitchen appliances and even your allergic preferences. Now the GenAI model can craft a Thanksgiving feast understanding the parameters and data without having to be guided. This is exactly what Semantic Kernel functions provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel functions come in two flavors: \n",
    "* Semantic functions\n",
    "* Native functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic functions are basically **prompt instructions** that help guide GenAI LLMs around the specific guidelines it should adhere to when building the AI orchestration. Therefore, semantic functions are likely the first place most AI architects/engineers start when composing AI orchestration with Semantic Kernel. Semantic functions can also take in parameters for dynamic creaation of instructions.  "

      "Opening a restaurant is a major decision that requires careful planning and consideration of both personal and financial factors. Based on the information provided, here’s a structured recommendation for Michael:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Evaluate Financial Feasibility**\n",
      "   - **Startup Costs**: Opening a restaurant typically requires significant upfront investment, including leasing a space, renovations, equipment, licenses, and initial inventory. Michael should research estimated startup costs in his desired location and compare them to his $500,000 net worth.\n",
      "   - **Emergency Fund**: Michael should ensure he retains a financial safety net. A general rule of thumb is to keep at least 6–12 months' worth of living expenses separate from business funds in case the restaurant takes time to become profitable.\n",
      "   - **Funding Options**: If the startup costs exceed what Michael is comfortable investing, he can explore options like business loans, investors, or partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Conduct Market Research**\n",
      "   - **Understand the Competition**: Since the competition level is medium, Michael should identify gaps in the market that he can fill. For example, offering a unique cuisine, exceptional service, or a distinctive dining experience could set his restaurant apart.\n",
      "   - **Target Audience**: Define the ideal customer base and ensure the concept aligns with their preferences and spending habits.\n",
      "   - **Location**: Choose a location with good foot traffic, visibility, and accessibility for the target audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Leverage Support System**\n",
      "   - **Friends and Family**: Since Michael has high support from friends and family, he can involve them in brainstorming ideas, seeking honest feedback, and even helping with initial marketing efforts.\n",
      "   - **Networking**: Michael should also connect with other restaurant owners, chefs, and industry professionals to gain insights and advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Start Small or Test the Concept**\n",
      "   - Before committing to a full-scale restaurant, Michael could consider testing his concept through:\n",
      "     - **Pop-Up Restaurants**: Temporary dining experiences to gauge interest and gather feedback.\n",
      "     - **Catering or Private Events**: Building a customer base and refining his menu.\n",
      "     - **Food Trucks**: A lower-cost entry point to establish his brand and test the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Develop a Business Plan**\n",
      "   - A detailed business plan is essential for success. It should include:\n",
      "     - Concept and vision\n",
      "     - Market analysis\n",
      "     - Financial projections (startup costs, revenue, and profit margins)\n",
      "     - Marketing strategy\n",
      "     - Operational plan (staffing, suppliers, and daily operations)\n",
      "   - This plan will also be crucial if Michael seeks external funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Prepare for Challenges**\n",
      "   - **Time Commitment**: Running a restaurant is demanding and may impact Michael’s personal life. He should ensure he’s prepared for the long hours and stress involved.\n",
      "   - **Risk Management**: Restaurants can have high failure rates. Michael should plan for contingencies, such as slower-than-expected growth or unexpected expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**\n",
      "   - Consult with professionals, such as:\n",
      "     - A financial advisor to assess his investment capacity.\n",
      "     - A business consultant to refine his strategy.\n",
      "     - A lawyer to navigate leases, permits, and contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Follow His Passion**\n",
      "   - If opening a restaurant aligns with Michael’s long-term career goals and personal aspirations, and he has a clear plan to mitigate risks, it could be a fulfilling endeavor. His passion for cooking and support from loved ones are strong foundations for success.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Recommendation:\n",
      "Michael should proceed cautiously and strategically. Start by conducting thorough research, testing his concept on a smaller scale, and ensuring he has a solid financial and operational"
