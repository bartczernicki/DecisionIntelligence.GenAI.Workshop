    "Semantic Kernel Functions are the core building blocks of functionality for intelligent AI orchestration. Semantic Kernel functions usually have a single responsibility to perform. For example, a Sementic Kernel function can: send an e-mail, call an API, recommend a reasoning framework for a high-stakes decision etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Semantic Kernel functions so special? Can't one just produce similar outcomes by using a prompt in an LLM or just writing a software program? In order to answer that, one has to look at what makes GenAI so innovative. The GenAI models have a unique ability to process instructions with reasoning and logic. This allows these models to behave almost like a human decision maker. Even with basic prompts, GenAI models perform reasonably well. However, providing GenAI models with additional functions allows them to gain access to business processes, data and basically anything a GenAI model should consider when performing AI orchestration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to prepare a great Thanksgiving dinner and want to get help from a GenAI cooking application to create a new recipe. You enter what you want todo and it comes up with the most delicious looking feast for Thanksgiving. However, there is a problem it used ingredients and recommended using cooking appliances that you do not own! You could enter all of the ingredients and keep prompting until it narrowed down the what you could realistically make. Wouldn't it be better if the GenAI cooking application had access to: your available ingredients, your time availability, kitchen appliances and even your allergic preferences. Now the GenAI model can craft a Thanksgiving feast understanding the parameters and data without having to be guided. This is exactly what Semantic Kernel functions provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel functions come in two flavors: \n",
    "* Semantic functions\n",
    "* Native functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic functions are basically **prompt instructions** that help guide GenAI LLMs around the specific guidelines it should adhere to when building the AI orchestration. Therefore, semantic functions are likely the first place most AI architects/engineers start when composing AI orchestration with Semantic Kernel. Semantic functions can also take in parameters for dynamic creaation of instructions.  "

      "Given the information provided, opening a restaurant might be a very risky venture for Michael at this time. Here are some key considerations and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Financial Stability**: Michael's net worth is currently $0, which means he does not have a financial cushion to fall back on. Opening a restaurant typically requires significant upfront investment for rent, equipment, staff, and initial inventory. Without sufficient savings or access to capital, Michael may struggle to cover these costs and sustain the business during the initial period when profits are uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **High Competition**: The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and entering a market with high competition can be challenging, especially for a new business. Michael would need a unique selling proposition or a niche that sets his restaurant apart from others to attract customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Low Support System**: Starting a business is demanding and often stressful. Having a strong support system from friends and family can provide emotional and sometimes financial support. With low support from his personal network, Michael might find it more difficult to cope with the challenges of running a new restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Build Financial Reserves**: Michael should consider building up his savings or securing funding before opening a restaurant. This could involve working as a chef for a few more years, seeking investors, or exploring small business loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Market Research and Planning**: Conduct thorough market research to identify gaps in the local restaurant market. Developing a solid business plan that includes detailed financial projections, marketing strategies, and a clear value proposition will be crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gain Experience and Network**: Michael could benefit from gaining more experience in the restaurant industry, perhaps by taking on a managerial role or working in different types of restaurants to understand various business models. Networking with other professionals in the industry could also provide valuable insights and potential partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Start Small**: Consider starting with a smaller-scale venture, such as a food truck, pop-up restaurant, or catering business. This would require less initial investment and allow Michael to test his concept and build a customer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Seek Mentorship**: Finding a mentor who has experience in the restaurant industry can provide guidance and help Michael navigate the complexities of starting and running a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while opening a restaurant is a significant and potentially rewarding endeavor, it is essential for Michael to address his financial situation, conduct thorough research, and build a support network before taking the plunge. Starting small and gradually scaling up could be a more sustainable approach."
