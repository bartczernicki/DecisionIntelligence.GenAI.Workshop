    "Semantic Kernel Functions are the core building blocks of functionality for intelligent AI orchestration. Semantic Kernel functions usually have a single responsibility to perform. For example, a Sementic Kernel function can: send an e-mail, call an API, recommend a reasoning framework for a high-stakes decision etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Semantic Kernel functions so special? Can't one just produce similar outcomes by using a prompt in an LLM or just writing a software program? In order to answer that, one has to look at what makes GenAI so innovative. The GenAI models have a unique ability to process instructions with reasoning and logic. This allows these models to behave almost like a human decision maker. Even with basic prompts, GenAI models perform reasonably well. However, providing GenAI models with additional functions allows them to gain access to business processes, data and basically anything a GenAI model should consider when performing AI orchestration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to prepare a great Thanksgiving dinner and want to get help from a GenAI cooking application to create a new recipe. You enter what you want todo and it comes up with the most delicious looking feast for Thanksgiving. However, there is a problem it used ingredients and recommended using cooking appliances that you do not own! You could enter all of the ingredients and keep prompting until it narrowed down the what you could realistically make. Wouldn't it be better if the GenAI cooking application had access to: your available ingredients, your time availability, kitchen appliances and even your allergic preferences. Now the GenAI model can craft a Thanksgiving feast understanding the parameters and data without having to be guided. This is exactly what Semantic Kernel functions provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel functions come in two flavors: \n",
    "* Semantic functions\n",
    "* Native functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic functions are basically **prompt instructions** that help guide GenAI LLMs around the specific guidelines it should adhere to when building the AI orchestration. Therefore, semantic functions are likely the first place most AI architects/engineers start when composing AI orchestration with Semantic Kernel. Semantic functions can also take in parameters for dynamic creaation of instructions.  "
