    "Semantic Kernel Functions are the core building blocks of functionality for intelligent AI orchestration. Semantic Kernel functions usually have a single responsibility to perform. For example, a Sementic Kernel function can: send an e-mail, call an API, recommend a reasoning framework for a high-stakes decision etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Semantic Kernel functions so special? Can't one just produce similar outcomes by using a prompt in an LLM or just writing a software program? In order to answer that, one has to look at what makes GenAI so innovative. The GenAI models have a unique ability to process instructions with reasoning and logic. This allows these models to behave almost like a human decision maker. Even with basic prompts, GenAI models perform reasonably well. However, providing GenAI models with additional functions allows them to gain access to business processes, data and basically anything a GenAI model should consider when performing AI orchestration. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to prepare a great Thanksgiving dinner and want to get help from a GenAI cooking application to create a new recipe. You enter what you want todo and it comes up with the most delicious looking feast for Thanksgiving. However, there is a problem it used ingredients and recommended using cooking appliances that you do not own! You could enter all of the ingredients and keep prompting until it narrowed down the what you could realistically make. Wouldn't it be better if the GenAI cooking application had access to: your available ingredients, your time availability, kitchen appliances and even your allergic preferences. Now the GenAI model can craft a Thanksgiving feast understanding the parameters and data without having to be guided. This is exactly what Semantic Kernel functions provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel functions come in two flavors: \n",
    "* Semantic functions\n",
    "* Native functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic functions are basically **prompt instructions** that help guide GenAI LLMs around the specific guidelines it should adhere to when building the AI orchestration. Therefore, semantic functions are likely the first place most AI architects/engineers start when composing AI orchestration with Semantic Kernel. Semantic functions can also take in parameters for dynamic creaation of instructions.  "

      "\n",
      "### 1. **Evaluate Financial Readiness**\n",
      "   - **Net Worth:** With a net worth of $500,000, Michael has a solid financial foundation. However, opening a restaurant can be expensive, with costs for leasing, equipment, staffing, inventory, marketing, and more. He should:\n",
      "     - Determine how much of his net worth he is willing to invest without jeopardizing his financial stability.\n",
      "     - Consider securing additional funding (e.g., loans, investors) to reduce personal financial risk.\n",
      "     - Create a detailed budget and financial plan, including a contingency fund for unexpected expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Conduct Market Research**\n",
      "   - **Competition:** The high level of competition suggests that Michael needs to identify a unique value proposition to stand out. He should:\n",
      "     - Research the local market to identify gaps or underserved niches (e.g., cuisine type, dining experience, price point).\n",
      "     - Analyze competitors to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and customer base.\n",
      "     - Test his concept with pop-up events, catering, or collaborations before committing to a full-scale restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Leverage Support Network**\n",
      "   - **Friends and Family Support:** High support from friends and family is a significant advantage. Michael can:\n",
      "     - Seek advice, feedback, and potential partnerships from his network.\n",
      "     - Involve them in the process, such as taste-testing menus or helping with marketing through word-of-mouth and social media.\n",
      "     - Consider whether any friends or family members have skills (e.g., business management, marketing) that could complement his culinary expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Develop a Business Plan**\n",
      "   - A comprehensive business plan is essential for success. It should include:\n",
      "     - A clear vision and mission for the restaurant.\n",
      "     - Target audience and marketing strategy.\n",
      "     - Menu development and pricing strategy.\n",
      "     - Location analysis (foot traffic, demographics, lease costs).\n",
      "     - Staffing plan and operational workflow.\n",
      "     - Financial projections and break-even analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Start Small and Test the Waters**\n",
      "   - Given the high competition, Michael might consider starting with a lower-risk approach, such as:\n",
      "     - A food truck or pop-up restaurant to test his concept and build a customer base.\n",
      "     - A partnership with an existing restaurant or shared kitchen space.\n",
      "     - Catering or private dining services to generate income and refine his offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Assess Personal Readiness**\n",
      "   - Opening a restaurant is demanding and can impact personal life. Michael should:\n",
      "     - Reflect on his willingness to commit to long hours, financial risk, and the stress of running a business.\n",
      "     - Ensure he has a support system in place to help him manage the challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**\n",
      "   - Michael should consult with professionals, such as:\n",
      "     - A business mentor or advisor with experience in the restaurant industry.\n",
      "     - An accountant to help with financial planning and tax considerations.\n",
      "     - A lawyer to review leases, permits, and contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Plan for Long-Term Sustainability**\n",
      "   - To thrive in a competitive market, Michael should focus on:\n",
      "     - Building a strong brand and customer loyalty.\n",
      "     - Continuously innovating and adapting to market trends.\n",
      "     - Prioritizing quality and consistency in food and service.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Recommendation:\n",
      "Michael should proceed cautiously and strategically. Starting small with a test concept (e.g., pop-up, food truck) can help him validate his idea, minimize financial risk, and gain valuable experience as a business owner. If the test"
