    "One of the most effective techniques to improve logic, reasoning and overall decision-making for most LLMs is to use \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) techniques. The \"Chain of Thought\" approach helps by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, making it easier to solve problems without missing important details. It improves accuracy because each step is made clear to the LLM and helps avoid mistakes. This method also makes the thought process easier to understand and explain, allowing for easier corrections when something goes wrong. The approach is useful for handling difficult concepts and multi-step problems like math or logic, making things clearer and more manageable.\n",

    "The name of the \"Chain of Thought\" technique has been recently popularized by Generative AI. However, this technique is not new nor is it specific only to Generative AI models. Breaking down complex tasks into simpler more approachable steps and organizing thoughts has been used by decision-makers, professional services organizations and management consulting companies for quite some time. Prior to Generative AI, the concepts have been known as: \"structured thinking\", \"MECE framework\" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), and \"hypothesis-driven problem-solving\".  "
