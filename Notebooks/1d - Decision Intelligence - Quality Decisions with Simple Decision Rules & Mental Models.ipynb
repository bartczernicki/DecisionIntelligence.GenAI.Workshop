    "I personally enjoy the quote above from Charlie Munger, as it highlights that intuition (experience) is simply not enough to make decisions. What is really needed is a \"latticework\" of models in your head. What is meant by \"models in your head\"? Charlie Munger is not advocating about performing calculus or linear algebra in your head. Instead he advocates for the use of simple techniques, mental models, and rules of thumb that can be combined to enhance decision-making quality and quantity. By applying these tools, you can develop the ability to tackle and solve a wider range of problems, leading to more effective and efficient decision-making.  \n",

    "Below is a list of simple decision rules that can be used for quick decision-making. Notice **these rules are generic and can be applied to many different domains, industries, fields** etc. For example, the generic \"10,000 Hour Rule\" which suggests in order to become a master in any field requires 10,000 hours of study, practice or hands-on experience. This rule essentially can be applied to any practice. If you want to master software development, cooking, basketball, playing the piano etc. this rule provides you a rough time guideline to achieve this goal. Is this rule perfect? Of course not, some people may take a little less time, some might need more than 10,000 hours and some may never achieve \"mastery\" no matter how much they practice. However, it is a great guide of the required time investment that allows you to plan your decisions accordingly to achieve this goal. \n",

    "There are many generic decision rules beyond what is illustrated in the table below. **Generative AI can be instructed with a collection of these decision rules, how to apply them for decision-making.

    "| :--------------------- | :------------- | \n",
    "| 10,000 Hour Rule | A concept popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book *\"Outliers: The Story of Success\".* The rule suggests that achieving mastery in any field (industry) requires approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. |  \n",
    "| Ben Franklin's Pro & Con List | Invented by Ben Franklin, this simple decision-making process suggests a user make a list Pro and Con for a binary decision, sort each side by importance, cross off equal important pros vs cons. Whichever side (Pro or Con) has more items, then make that decision. |  \n",
    "| Price's Law | In any given domain (industry), half of the work is done by the square root of the total number of people who participate in that work. For example, if there are 100 people working on a project, roughly 10 of them will be responsible for half of the results. |  \n",
    "| Rule of Succession | Principle from probability theory, specifically Bayesian probability, that provides a method for predicting the likelihood of future events based on past observations. For example, can solve the question \"What is the probability of the sun rising tomorrow?\" |  \n",
    "| Ludic Fallacy | The term \"ludic\" comes from the Latin word \"ludus,\" which means \"game.\" The fallacy refers to the misguided belief that the structured and simplified probabilities and models used in games and formal settings can be applied directly to understand real-life complexities and uncertainties. |  \n",
    "| 90% Rule | Only persue decision paths that are a \"Hell Yeah!\". If it is immediately apparent that the path forward offers the most chance of success, then this is the decision that should be selected. Can be quantified as the 90% rule, as only select decisions that have a 90% chance of succeedding. |  \n",
    "| Small Bets | This rule was popularized by Nicholas Taleb in his book *\"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder\"*. It suggests to make small, reversible bets to test ideas and strategies. This allows you to learn and adapt without risking catastrophic losses. |  \n",
    "| Sample of One | This decision tactic recommends to consider even the smallest sample sizes, even a sample of one. Applied correctly, the \"sample of one\" rule statistically shows that the first influence or being able to \"peek\" at just one sample can provide a decision-making advantage. |  \n",
    "| Exploration vs Exploitation | Provides a trade-off between two competing strategies. Exploration involves trying new actions to discover potentially better options, while exploitation uses current knowledge to maximize immediate rewards. The key trade-off is between gaining new information (exploration) and optimizing based on known information (exploitation). |  \n",

    "There have been hundreds of simple decision rules created that are specific to various domains (industries).

Almost every domain (industry) has created \"rules of thumb\" for a variety of reasons to help people arrive at conclusions rapidly with little effort.\n",

    "Those objects are not looking at the purpose of these simple domain rules. These rules allow for quick guidance, recommendations without having to perform much calculation. For example, a nurtionist may recommend exercises for you that optimize healthy weight management.

Furthermore, these rules can easily be applied to decision-making with Generative AI as the GenAI models are either familiar with the rule already or the simple domain specific rule can be described to aid the decision-making process.

    "| Entertainment (Movies) | Box Office 2.5x Rule | A general rule that a movie needs to make 2.5x it's movie budget in order to break even. This rule includes estimates of marketing and other production costs. For example, if a movie cost 100 million dollars, in order to break even it would need to bring in 250 million from the box office alone.  |  \n",

For example, a couple retiring with $1 million in savings will have 4% or $40,000/year they can use during their retirement. |  \n",

    "| Economics | Scholte's Revenue Fallacy | A concept in economics that highlights a common misunderstanding about the relationship between revenue and costs in business operations. This fallacy occurs when business owners or managers mistakenly believe that simply increasing revenue will automatically lead to higher profits without considering the associated costs and the impact on overall profitability. |  \n",

    "There are much more complex statistical and machine learning techniques that can scale to thousands, millions or even billions of data points.

Supervised learning is when you have a set of data points/inputs paired with decision outcomes. Those can be sent to a statistical or machine learning algorithm that learns the data to outcome interactions using sophisticed math & statistical algorithms. The output of that learning process is a \"model\". This model (specific to your decision use-case) can take new data points for a decision and output predictions (probabilities) or decision recommendations.  \n",
