## Requirements - To Read (Not Execute Code)

1. No special requirements to read the content. All the of the text, links & images are available by just navigating to the Notebooks folder and reading the section modules sequentially.   
2. All of the interactive results from the code execution are available to read as well. Those results are pre-cached and it can be read as if you had executed the code interactively.  

## Requirements - Interactive Notebooks

1. VS Code running on your workstation or VSCode with GitHub CodeSpaces or Azure Machine Learning Notebooks  
2. Install .NET 8 SDK
