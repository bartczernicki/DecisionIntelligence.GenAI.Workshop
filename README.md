## About 

The **Decision Intelligence GenAI Workshop** is an interactive course that pairs with an upcoming book called **"Decision Intelligence with Generative AI"**. This course primarily focuses on three areas:  
* Introduction to Decision-Making with a Decision Intelligence Framework that covers systematic processes of making decisions   
* Application of Decision Intelligence theory with Generative AI 
* Interative Notebooks for AI engineers/software engineers to execute the examples with an orchestration framework (Semantic Kernel & OpenAI)  

The unique structure with diverse focus areas, allows the workshop to be consumed in several ways. Depending on your familiarity with decision theory or AI acumen, you have several paths to get started.

All the of the text, links & images are available by just navigating to the Notebooks folder and reading the section modules sequentially. Notebooks folder:   https://github.com/bartczernicki/DecisionIntelligence.GenAI.Workshop/tree/main/Notebooks  
  -  All Generative AI output is pre-run and available to read. 
  -  Recommend further detailed book resources provided in the workshop to immerse yourself in Decision Theory, Decision-Making, Cognitive Theory etc. 
  -  Recommend companion book "Generative AI with Decision Intelligence" (coming late 2025).
5. All of the interactive results from the code execution are available to read as well. Those results are pre-cached and it can be read as if you had executed the code interactively.
